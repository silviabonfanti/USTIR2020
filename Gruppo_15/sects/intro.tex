\section{Introduction}

Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as solid free-form fabrication or layer-based manufacture, is a method of creating physical objects from digital models by depositing thin layers of materials in a “layer-by-layer” process \cite{Wang2020},\cite{Saxon2020}, \cite{Sun2019}. Its different from traditional subtractive manufacturing (the process consists of removing material from a bulk part) since it can work with different materials at the same time and does not waste many resources \cite{Ferreira2019}. Additive manufacturing also allowed designing and prototyping be accomplished fasters (in few hours or days), the creation of customer-specific designs and to rapid scale on-demand, which is revolutionizing the manufacturing sector entirely \cite{Rosa2018},\cite{Boni2020}.

According to the ISO/ASTM 52900, it is possible to divide the additive manufacturing techniques into six categories (Figure 1), where each technology was developed to process different forms and types of materials.
