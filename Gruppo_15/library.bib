abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2016.This article explores the experiences of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar with infrastructure public–private partnerships (PPPs), and offers new insights into the development of the PPP phenomenon outside of the Western context. It analyzes their approaches to PPPs, including policy frameworks, the rationales for their implementation, and presents a critical examination of PPP projects' development to date. In contrast to the international trend where PPPs have been used for the objectives of overcoming financial constraints or delivering public infrastructure efficiently, it is argued that PPPs in the three Gulf states are in their infancy, and their use has been restricted to sectors where the governments cannot deliver important projects. The article concludes by identifying the three Gulf states' future directions in the use of infrastructure PPPs to deliver a broader spectrum of mega-infrastructure projects, particularly in light of dwindling oil revenues.},

abstract = {The ongoing discussion regarding blockchain technologies is focused primarily on cryptocurrencies, but blockchain features and functionalities have developed beyond financial instruments. As the technologies provide new functionalities, the associated value proposition changes as well. This study explores the relationship between blockchain technologies and their underlying value drivers. Four identified distinct blockchain stages of increased maturity are analyzed and discussed. This covers the evolutionary technology types focused on transactions, smart contracts, decentralized applications, and the introduction of artificial intelligence supporting decentralized decision making. In addition, we address management issues around appropriate blockchain adoption using a blockchain value driver-focused framework that gives decision makers actionable questions and recommendations. We provide practitioners with a method for assessing suitable blockchain adoption that addresses the specific value creation associated with a given organizational strategy. For academics, we critically identify and assess the characteristics of the blockchain stages and their strategy implications and provide a structured approach conceptualizing blockchain technology evolution.},

abstract = {Polymerization of cyclic esters at the properly chosen conditions can be treated as living polymerization, in agreement with the tentative definition of the Nomenclature Commission of IUPAC (Macromolecular Division) requiring that no irreversible transfer or irreversible termination take place. For these processes the most kinetic or structural (end group) studies do not reveal any deviation. However, since in these polymerizations reversible transfer to backbones of macromolecules and/or reversible deactivation take place, the molar mass distribution can be Poissonian only at certain conditions. These processes have been studied quantitatively and the corresponding rate constants were determined. Thus, the importance of these processes could be established by comparing the rate constants of propagation. In this way, polymerizations of cyclic esters were used to illustrate the meaning and scope of the definition of "living polymerization", a process from which irreversible transfer and deactivation are absent and in which living polymers are formed, i.e. composed of macromolecules that do not irreversibly loose their ability to grow},

abstract = {Interest in microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) has been increasing exponentially. During the last decade, this bio-based nanomaterial was essentially used in nanocomposites for its reinforcement property. Its nano-scale dimensions and its ability to form a strong entangled nanoporous network, however, have encouraged the emergence of new high-value applications. In previous years, its mode of production has completely changed, as many forms of optimization have been developed. New sources, new mechanical processes, and new pre- and post-treatments are currently under development to reduce the high energy consumption and produce new types of MFC materials on an industrial scale. The nanoscale characterization possibilities of different MFC materials are thus increasing intensively. Therefore, it is critical to review such MFC materials and their properties. Moreover, very recent studies have proved the significant barrier properties of MFC. Hence, it is proposed to focus on the barrier properties of MFC used in films, in nanocomposites, or in paper coating. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This research uses sensemaking theory to explore how emerging blockchain technology may transform supply chains. We investigate three research questions (RQs): What are blockchain technology's perceived benefits to supply chains, where are disruptions mostly likely to occur and what are the potential challenges to further blockchain diffusion? We conducted in-depth interviews with 14 supply chain experts. Cognitive mapping and narrative analysis were deployed as the two main data analysis techniques to aid our understanding and evaluation of people's cognitive complexity in making sense of blockchain technology. We found that individual experts developed different cognitive structures within their own sensemaking processes. After merging individual cognitive maps into a strategic map, we identified several themes and central concepts that then allowed us to explore potential answers to the three RQs. Our study is among the very few to date to explicitly explore how blockchains may transform supply chain practices. Using the sensemaking approach afforded a deeper understanding of how senior executives diagnose the symptoms evident from blockchains and develop assumptions, expectations and knowledge of the technology, which will then shape their future actions regarding its utilisation. We demonstrate the usefulness of sensemaking theory as an alternative lens in investigating contemporary supply chain phenomena such as blockchains. Bringing sensemaking theory to this discipline in particular enriches emerging behavioural operations research. Our contributions also lie in extending the theories of prospective sensemaking and adding further insights to the stream of technology adoption studies.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a mask-image-projection- based stereolithography (MIP-SL) process that can combine two base materials with various concentrations and structures to produce a solid object with desired material characteristics. Stereolithography is an additive manufacturing process in which liquid photopolymer resin is cross-linked and converted to solid. The fabrication of digital material requires frequent resin changes during the building process. The process presented in this paper attempts to address the related challenges in achieving such fabrication capability. Design/methodology/approach - A two-channel system design is presented for the multi-material MIP-SL process. In such a design, a coated thick film and linear motions in two axes are used to reduce the separation force of a cured layer. The material cleaning approach to thoroughly remove resin residue on built surfaces is presented for the developed process. Based on a developed testbed, experimental studies were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the presented process on digital material fabrication. Findings - The proposed two-channel system can reduce the separation force of a cured layer by an order of magnitude in the bottom-up projection system. The developed two-stage cleaning approach can effectively remove resin residue on built surfaces. Several multi-material designs have been fabricated to highlight the capability of the developed MIP-SL process. Research limitations/implications - A proof-of-concept testbed has been developed. Its building speed and accuracy can be further improved. The tests were limited to the same type of liquid resins. In addition, the removal of trapped air is a challenge in the presented process. Originality/value - This paper presents a novel and a pioneering approach towards digital material fabrication based on the stereolithography process. This research contributes to the additive manufacturing development by significantly expanding the selection of base materials in fabricating solid objects with desired material characteristics. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology is getting a growing attention from various organizations and researchers as it provides magical solutions to the problems associated with the classical centralized architecture. Blockchain, whether public or private, is a distributed ledger with the capability of maintaining the integrity of transactions by decentralizing the ledger among participating users. On the other hand, the Internet of Things (IoT) represents a revolution of the Internet which can connect nearly all environment devices over the Internet to share their data to create novel services and applications for improving our quality of life. Although the centralized IoT system provides countless benefits, it raises several challenges. Resolving these challenges can be done by integrating IoT with blockchain technology. To be prepared for the integration process, this chapter provides an overview of technical aspects of the blockchain and IoT. It started by reviewing blockchain technology and its main structure. Applications and challenges of the blockchain are also presented. This is followed by reviewing the IoT system by highlighting common architecture and essential characteristics. Various applications and challenges of the IoT system are also discussed.},

abstract = {Polylactic Acid (PLA) is the first viable thermoplastic that can be produced from a plant-based feedstock such as corn or sugar cane, and yet be processed by the conventional melt processing technologies. At the same time, Polylactic Acid is produced at the largest industrial scale of all biodegradable polymers. It is being used in biomedical applications, for bottle production and in compostable food packaging. It is also being evaluated as a material for tissue engineering. Mass production has tremendously reduced the cost of PLA production, making it an economically viable choice for fabrication of domestic containers, plastic bags, and fibers. Commercial-scale plants today produce hundreds of thousand tons of PLA per year. This book provides a practical guide for the engineers and scientists involved in working with PLA and developing the many new products that are emerging for this important biopolymer. The current market situation for PLA and biodegradable polymers is described as well as applications across a range of market sectors, and the mechanical, chemical, thermal, rheology, and degradation properties of PLA. •An essential reference for engineers, scientists and product designers considering switching to a sustainable plastic. •Covers the properties, synthesis and polymerization of PLA, and processing techniques involved in fabricating parts from this polymer.},

abstract = {A method for the preparation of 3D printing wire rods of a micro/nanocellulose-polylactic acid (MNC/PLA) composite with up to 30{\%} MNC constitution was developed. The micro/nanocellulose (MNC) obtained through a simple mechanical treatment of polyols swelled bleached softwood pulp possessed a mixture of micro-cellulose fibers (width was less than 2 $\mu$m) and nanocellulose fibers (width was at nanoscale). The results showed that the interfacial compatibility of MNC and PLA was improved by adding silane coupling agent (KH-550). The composition of MNC with PLA greatly decreased the melt flow rate, nevertheless, the addition of PEG increased the rate to some degree (0.568 g/10 min) to meet the printable demands for 3D printing with a FDM printer with a decomposition temperature of 250 °C–400 °C. The optimum ratio for the preparation of MNC/PLA composites for 3D printing was determined to be as follows: 30 wt{\%} MNC modified with KH550, 5 wt{\%} PEG6000, and 65 wt{\%} PLA. At the optimum condition, the mechanical property of 3D products from MNC/PLA composites was maintained at a comparable level to that of neat PLA with elongation at break of 12{\%}, tensile strength of 59.7 MPa and flexural strength of 50.7 MPa.},

abstract = {Isoelectric soya-protein precipitate densities were measured for mean particle sizes ranging from 3.4-65 microm by gradient centrifugation, centrifugation in water-immiscible solvents, tracerdilution, gravity sedimentation of isolated particles. Coulter counter volume determination, and a comparison of Coulter counter and centrifugal sedimentation size distributions. The immiscible system and tracer dilution methods were both found to be unreliable due to experimental uncertainties. The Coulter counter volume measurement indicated the existence of a density-size relationship with the aggregate density decreasing as the size increased. Comparison with sedimentation measurements showed that the Coulter counter measures 80{\%} of the total aggregate volume for 6-microm particles. The relation between aggregate density (rho(a), kg m (-3)) and size (d, microm) was measured for isoelectric soya protein and casein precipitated by ammonium sulfate, using a comparison of the Coulter counter size distribution and centrifugal sedimentation. The functions were described for soya by [rho(alpha) - 1001 = 246d-0.408 and for casein by rho(alpha) - 1136 = 31d-0.441]. The gradient centrifugation method measured the buoyant density of hydrated protein precipitate which was independent of size, and is consistent with an aggregate structure consisting of primary particles. However, the aggregate structure was not described for all sizes by the theoretical cubic packing of hard-sphere primary particles, nor by the successive random addition of primary particles. The density-size functions indicated up to a fivefold difference in Stokes settling velocities compared to those calculated assuming a constant density difference.},

abstract = {3D printing is gaining popularity by providing a tool for fast, cost-effective, and highly customizable fabrication. However, little is known about the toxicity of 3D-printed objects. In this work, we assess the toxicity of printed parts from two main classes of commercial 3D printers, fused deposition modeling and stereolithography. We assessed the toxicity of these 3D-printed parts using zebrafish (Danio rerio), a widely used model organism in aquatic toxicology. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 3D-printed parts and monitored for rates of survival, hatching, and developmental abnormalities. We found that parts from both types of printers were measurably toxic to zebrafish embryos, with STL-printed parts significantly more toxic than FDM-printed parts. We also developed a simple post-printing treatment (exposure to ultraviolet light) that largely mitigates the toxicity of the STL-printed parts. Our results call attention to the need for strategies for the safe disposal of 3D-printed parts and printer waste materials.},

abstract = {Purpose - The present research investigates tailoring the physical properties of stereolithography (SL) epoxy-based resins by dispersing controlled small amounts of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) directly in SL resins prior to layered manufacturing. Design/methodology/approach - A modified 3D Systems 250/50 SL multi-material machine was used where the machine was equipped with a solid-state (355 nm) laser, unique ∼ 500 ml vat, overfill drain vat design that continuously flowed resin into the vat via a peristaltic pump, and 8.89 by 8.89 cm2 platform. The vat did not include a recoating system. Pumping the composite resin assisted in maintaining the MWCNTs dispersed over long periods of time (with MWCNT settling times on the order of one week). The research approach required developing a method for dispersing the MWCNTs in SL resin, determining new SL build parameters for the modified resin and SL machine, and building and testing tensile specimens. Findings - Mechanical mixing and ultrasonic dispersion provided simple means for dispersing MWCNTs in the SL resin. However, MWCNT agglomerates were observed in all the parts fabricated using the filled resins. Each concentration of MWCNTs resulted in a "new" resin requiring modifications to the SL build parameters, E C and DP. Once characterized, the modified resins performed similar to traditional resins in the SL process. Small dispersions of MWCNTs resulted in improvements in the tensile strength (TS) (or ultimate tensile stress) and fracture stress (FS) of tensile specimens as 0.025 percent (w/v) MWCNTs in DSM Somos{\textregistered} WaterShed™ 11120 resin resulted in increases in TS and FS of 5.7 percent and 26 percent, respectively, when compared to unfilled resin. Increasing the concentration of MWCNTs to 0.10 percent (w/v) resulted in increases in TS and FS of 7.5 percent and 33 percent, respectively, over the unfilled resin. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy showed strong affinity between the epoxy resin and the MWCNTs. Research limitations/implications - Additional MWCNT type and concentrations in various SL resins should be investigated along with additional means for dispersion to provide sufficient information on developing new SL resins for unique functional applications. Practical implications - It is anticipated that the methods described here will provide a basis for further development of advanced nanocomposite SL resins for end-use applications. Originality/value - This research successfully illustrated the dispersion and use of MWCNTs as a reinforcement material in a commercially available SL resin. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Results revealed that the chemical reaction of CNC with HDTMA led to the presence of new chemical groups (CH2, CH3 and quaternary ammonium groups) on the surface of the CNC. Experiments conducted by X-ray diffraction indicated no change in the crystalline structure as a result of the modification. Modified CNC had different suspension stabilities and dispersibility compared to unmodified CNC.

The difference in the rate of polymerization at high conversions for the two catalysts is caused by a difference in crystallinity of the newly formed polymer. Contaminants in the catalyst and monomer are the true initiators in these L-lactide polymerizations.

abstract = {A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T 2 An optimized paste based on short natural cellulose fibers combined with carboxymethyl cellulose at a high dry content (42 wt.{\%}) was implemented as a bio-based material for 3D printing by extrusion. The homogeneous paste exhibited a pronounced thinning behavior and yield stress; it was extruded using a screw extrusion-based direct ink writing system and could easily flow through a small nozzle. The optimized formulation enabled accurate additive manufacturing of parts using a natural air-drying process with or without an ethanol bath. We characterized the anisotropic shrinkage that occurred during the drying of 3D printed parts and proposed a compensation method to account for it. The obtained results emphasized that cellulose had a strong potential to be used as a raw material for 3D printing of cheap, lightweight, robust, and recyclable parts.},

abstract = {Precise control over the biomaterial, porosity, and inner architecture of a scaffold is essential for tissue regeneration. This paper proposes a new bi-pore scaffold that has both global and local pores in its structure. The global pores can serve as channels for supplying cells with nutrients and oxygen, while the local pores provide space for cell growth. A lost mold shape-forming process based on high-resolution microstereolithography technology was used to form the global pores, and conventional scaffold fabrication methods, such as salt leaching and phase inversion, were added to the molding process to generate local pores. This resulted in the fabrication of 300 to 400 $\mu$m global pores with the lost molding process; local pores of 30 to 100 $\mu$m and 1 to 5 $\mu$m were achieved with salt leaching and phase inversion, respectively. Compared to other processes, this fabrication process provides a powerful method for bi-pore scaffold fabrication.},

abstract = {A general research direction of stereolithography based on digital light processing (DLP) is to reduce the production time and to increase manufacturing accuracy. Compared to fused deposition modelling (FDM) machines, machines for DLP stereolithography are expensive and thus not available to a broad range of users as it is the case with FDM 3D printers. Comparing technologies, DLP stereolithography offers quicker and more accurate production. In this paper, performances of a low cost DLP stereolithographic printer is presented. Three main challenges are treated: an uneven illumination of commercial DLP projectors, a direction of illumination and a selection of optimal 3D printing parameters. Uneven illumination of DLP projector results in smaller usable working area and poor printing quality. The problem is solved by implementing an appropriate software mask, thus the product quality is not influenced by its position on a working table. The direction of illumination has a key role in DLP stereolithography. It is shown that constrained surface (illumination through a transparent bottom of the vat) gives better 3D printing accuracy compared to free surface (illumination of the photopolymer surface) stereolithography. To further improve the product quality, the optimal process parameters are determined. Using the Taguchi based surface response methodology optimal process parameters are defined and by using them, the deviation of the actual dimensions from the specified dimensions is less than 80 $\mu$m.},

@article{Storey2002,
abstract = {Bulk polymerizations of -caprolactone (CL) were conducted at 130 °C, in which the structure and amount of initiator were varied. Polymerization induction periods were observed and attributed to slow heat transfer and to the type of alcohol used as initiator. Induction periods persisted until virtually complete consumption of both ethylene glycol (EG) and 1,3-propanediol (PD). 1-Butanol displayed no detectable induction. 1H NMR suggested that induction was a result of strong and unique interactions between the diols and stannous octoate, which lead to the formation of more stable, less reactive stannous alkoxides compared to stannous alkoxides derived from the polymer chain end. Only after virtually all free diol was consumed did chain propagation commence at the normal rate. The rate of polymerization was insensitive to the [CL]/[EG] ratios chosen for this study. The results were consistent with a mechanism in which stannous alkoxide initiator is formed in situ via reaction between stannous octoate and alcohol, and stannous alkoxide chain ends are the actively propagating species.},

For customized tissue engineering, it is essential to be able to fabricate three-dimensional scaffolds of various geometric shapes, in or- der to repair defects caused by accidents, surgery, or birth. Rapid prototyping or solid free-form fabrication (SFF) techniques hold great promise for designing three-dimensional customized scaf- folds, yet traditional cell-seeding techniques may not provide enough cell mass for larger constructs. This article presents a novel attempt to fabricate three-dimensional scaffolds, using hydrogels com- bined with cell encapsulation to fabricate high-density tissue constructs. A commercially available stereolithography technique was applied to fabricate scaffolds using poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(ethylene glycol)dimethacrylate photopolymerizable hydrogels. Mechanical characterization shows the constructs to be comparable with soft tissues in terms of elasticity. High cell viability was achieved and high-density constructs fabricated. INTRODUCTION},

More than 20 amorphous solid dispersion-based products that have been approved for marketing consist of cellulose derivatives as stabilizers, thus highlighting their importance in generation of amorphous solid dispersions. These polymers offer numerous advantages like drug solubilization, crystallization inhibition and improvement in release patterns of drugs. Exploring their potential and exploiting their chemistry and pH responsive behaviour have led to the synthesis of new derivatives that has broadened the scope of the use of cellulose derivatives in amorphous formulation development. The present review aims to provide an overview of different mechanisms by which these cellulose derivatives inhibit the crystallization of drugs in the solid state and from supersaturated solution. A summary of different categories of cellulose derivatives along with the newly explored polymers has been provided. A special segment on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis and critical quality attributes (CQAs) which affect the performance of the cellulose based amorphous solid dispersion will aid the researchers in identifying the major challenges in the development of cellulose based solid dispersion and serve as a guide for further formulation development.},

abstract = {Nanocomposites composed of cellulose nanofiber (CNF) and polylactic acid (PLA) were prepared using a solvent casting method, with the goal of making green nanocomposites. Prior to the incorporation of CNF into the polymer matrix, surface modification of CNF was accompanied by esterification to improve the dispersion of CNF and its interfacial adhesion with the biopolymer. Microstructure, barrier, mechanical and thermal properties of the nanocomposites were studied. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs revealed uniform distribution of nanoparticles in the polymer matrix at low contents (1 and 3 wt{\%}), but also that a higher content (5 wt{\%}) of CNF was easily agglomerated. This caused the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites to be reduced. The results of water vapor permeability (WVP) tests showed that the use of acetylated nanofibers had no significant effect on the permeability of films. Tensile strength (TS) and elastic modulus (EM) of nanocomposites with 1 wt{\%} CNF did not show significant changes, however elongation percentage (E) increased by more than 60{\%}. The TS, EM and E changed significantly for nanocomposites with 3 and 5 wt{\%} CNF. Moreover, nanofiber orientation effectively occurred in the PLA matrix. The reinforcing effect of CNF composition with PLA caused a slight increase in glass transition and melting temperatures. However, the nanocomposite films showed a very similar pattern of thermal behavior to that of neat PLA film.},

In the last few years, nanocellulose has also attracted much attention due to environmental concerns. This review presents an overview of recent developments in this area, including the production, characterization, properties, and range of applications of nanocellulose-based biodegradable polymers, thermoplastic polymers, and porous nanocomposites. After explaining the unique properties of nanocellulose and its various preparation techniques, an orderly introduction of various nanocellulose-reinforced biodegradable polymers such as starch, proteins, alginate, chitosan, and gelatin is provided. Subsequently, the effects of nanocellulose on the properties of thermoplastic polymers such as polyamides, polysulfone, polypropyrol, and polyacronitril are reported. The paper concludes with a presentation of new finding and cutting-edge studies on nanocellulose foam and aerogel composites. Three different types of aerogels, i.e., pristine nanocellulose-based aerogels, modified nanocellulose-based aerogels, and nanocellulose-based templates for aerogels, are discussed, as well as their preparation techniques and properties. In the case of foam composites, the research focus has been on two major preparation techniques, i.e., solvent-mixing/foaming and melt-mixing foaming, their respective challenges, and the properties of the final composites. In some cases, a comparison study between cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose nanofiber-reinforced biodegradable polymers, thermoplastics, and porous nanocomposites was carried out. Considering the vast amount of research on nanocellulose-based composites, special emphasis on such composites isprovided at the end of the review.},

Further, an epoxy acrylate resin was synthesized from the epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) by using acrylic acid monomer. Triethylamine (TEA) and hydroquinone were used as a catalyst and inhibitor respectively. The acrylation of epoxidized soybean oil (AESO) is done by introducing acrylic acid, which is an unsaturated monomer into oxirane groups of the epoxidized oil (ESO). This reaction was confirmed by analytical data in terms of oxirane oxygen content, acid value, viscosity and spectral analysis. Different UV curable formulations have been investigated using synthesized acrylated resin and trifunctional acrylate monomer used as crosslinkable active diluents with photoinitiator. Monomer used was trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (TMPTMA) while photoinitiator used was benzophenone along with an activator dimethyl ethanol amine (DEA). The mixtures were cured to make thin polymeric films under UV radiation with optimum irradiation dosing time of 20 min to produce the excellent cured coating which exhibits good thermal stability of about},

abstract = {In this work, a stereolithography-based method of 3D printing was successfully used to fabricate a complex-shaped triangular zirconia cutting tool with a tool withdrawal groove and a honeycomb ceramic component. The sintered bodies displayed significant shrinkage after sintering, with the maximum shrinkage being 35.26{\%}. The XRD pattern indicated that the crystalline phase of the parts was the t-ZrO2 phase, while SEM characterization revealed that the sintered bodies were composed of densely packed submicron-grade grains, without any discernible pores. The density of the parts was measured as 97.14{\%} via Archimedes' water displacement method, which is consistent with the results of SEM characterization. Additionally, the measured Vickers hardness and fracture toughness of the fabricated parts were 13.0597 GPa and 6.0380 MPa m1/2, respectively. These values are close to the structural properties of common zirconia ceramics prepared by conventional approaches. Hence, a novel DLP-stereolithography-based 3D printing process for the fabrication of complex and dense zirconia ceramic parts has been proposed in this work.},

abstract = {For more than a decade, our group has been developing the methods and systems required to have spatial control over material placement and structure creation, leading to, for example, the realisation of complex three-dimensional (3D) devices that integrate electronics and thus intelligence within mechanical structures as well as 3D spatially complex bioactive, implantable, tissue engineered constructs. There are myriad issues associated with combining multiple materials to create functional products, ranging from the deposition and processing of different materials to the combined performance of the materials in the resulting product. Stereolithography (SL) has been the primary technology focus of this work because it offers high quality surface finish, dimensional accuracy, and a variety of material options that includes implantable materials. Moreover, SL builds in essentially ambient, minimally controlled environmental conditions that provide easy access to the build chamber and enable straightforward conversion of existing single material SL systems to multiple material and hybrid manufacturing systems. This paper describes the development of multiple material and multiple technology (hybrid) stereolithography systems capable of manufacturing multiple material structures with mechanical, electrical, and biochemical functionality. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Biocomposite nanofiber scaffolds of polycaprolactone (PCL) with different graphene oxide (GO) concentrations were prepared using electrospinning technology. The successful incorporation of GO nanosheets into PCL polymer nanofibers improved the thermal and mechanical properties of the nanofibers because of the intrinsic properties developed due to the interactions of GO and PCL. In order to estimate the biocompatibility of PCL/GO composite scaffolds, mouse marrow mesenchymal stem cells (mMSCs) and low-differentiated rat pheochromocytoma (PC12-L) cells were cultured. Initial adhesion and spreading of the mMSCs and PC12-L cells on PCL/GO composite scaffolds with moderate addition of GO (0.3 and 0.5 wt{\%}) were significantly superior to those on pure PCL scaffolds, and the cells exhibited typical fibroblast- and neuron-like morphologies with obvious pseudopods and mature appearance, respectively. A small amount of GO did not restrain the proliferation and viability of the mMSCs and PC12-L cells, which indicated appreciable cell affinity of GO. Moreover, the hybridization of GO nanosheets and PCL polymer dramatically enhanced the differentiation of the mMSCs and PC12-L cells into osteo- and neuro-like cells, respectively. All these results suggest that PCL/GO composite nanofibers could be a promising alternative material as biocompatible scaffolds for tissue engineering.},

abstract = {Photocurable, biocompatible liquid resins are highly desired for 3D stereolithography based bioprinting. Here we solidified a novel renewable soybean oil epoxidized acrylate, using a 3D laser printing technique, into smart and highly biocompatible scaffolds capable of supporting growth of multipotent human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Porous scaffolds were readily fabricated by simply adjusting the printer infill density; superficial structures of the polymerized soybean oil epoxidized acrylate were significantly affected by laser frequency and printing speed. Shape memory tests confirmed that the scaffold fixed a temporary shape at -18 °C and fully recovered its original shape at human body temperature (37 °C), which indicated the great potential for 4D printing applications. Cytotoxicity analysis proved that the printed scaffolds had significant higher hMSC adhesion and proliferation than traditional polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), and had no statistical difference from poly lactic acid (PLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL). This research is believed to significantly advance the development of biomedical scaffolds with renewable plant oils and advanced 3D fabrication techniques.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors. In this research, an ANOVA analysis and a response surface methodology are applied to analyze the equilibrium of methanol reaction from pure carbon dioxide and hydrogen. In the ANOVA analysis, carbon monoxide composition in the feed, reaction temperature, recycle and water removal through a zeolite membrane are the analyzed factors. Carbon conversion, methanol yield, methanol productivity and methanol selectivity are the analyzed responses. Results show that main factors have the same effect on responses and a common significant interaction is not present. Carbonmonoxide composition and water removal have a positive effect, while temperature and recycle have a negative effect on the system. From central composite design, an optimal solution is found in order to overcome thermodynamic limit: the reactor works with amembrane at lower temperature with carbon monoxide composition in the feed equal to 10 mol {\%} and without recycle. In these conditions, carbon conversion, methanol yield, methanol selectivity, and methanol production are, respectively, higher than 60{\%}, higher than 60{\%}, between 90{\%} and 95{\%} and higher than 0.15mol/h when considering a feed flow rate of 1 mol/h. A comparison with a traditional reactor is also developed: the membrane reactor ensures to have a carbon conversion higher of the 29{\%} and a methanol yield higher of the 34{\%}. Future researches should evaluate an economic analysis about the optimal solution.},

abstract = {During the resorbable-polymer-boom of the 1970s and 1980s, polycaprolactone (PCL) was used extensively in the biomaterials field and a number of drug-delivery devices. Its popularity was soon superseded by faster resorbable polymers which had fewer perceived disadvantages associated with long-term degradation (up to 3-4 years) and intracellular resorption pathways; consequently, PCL was almost forgotten for most of two decades. Recently, a resurgence of interest has propelled PCL back into the biomaterials-arena. The superior rheological and viscoelastic properties over many of its aliphatic polyester counterparts renders PCL easy to manufacture and manipulate into a large range of implants and devices. Coupled with relatively inexpensive production routes and FDA approval, this provides a promising platform for the design and fabrication of longer term degradable implants which may be manipulated physically, chemically and biologically to possess tailorable degradation kinetics to suit a specific anatomical site. This review will discuss the application of PCL as a biomaterial over the last two decades focusing on the advantages which have propagated its return into the spotlight with a particular focus on medical devices, drug delivery and tissue engineering. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In new product development, time to market (TTM) is critical for the success and profitability of next generation products. When these products include sophisticated electronics encased in 3D packaging with complex geometries and intricate detail, TTM can be compromised - resulting in lost opportunity. The use of advanced 3D printing technology enhanced with component placement and electrical interconnect deposition can provide electronic prototypes that now can be rapidly fabricated in comparable time frames as traditional 2D bread-boarded prototypes; however, these 3D prototypes include the advantage of being embedded within more appropriate shapes in order to authentically prototype products earlier in the development cycle. The fabrication freedom offered by 3D printing techniques, such as stereolithography and fused deposition modeling have recently been explored in the context of 3D electronics integration - referred to as 3D structural electronics or 3D printed electronics. Enhanced 3D printing may eventually be employed to manufacture end-use parts and thus offer unit-level customization with local manufacturing; however, until the materials and dimensional accuracies improve (an eventuality), 3D printing technologies can be employed to reduce development times by providing advanced geometrically appropriate electronic prototypes. This paper describes the development process used to design a novelty six-sided gaming die. The die includes a microprocessor and accelerometer, which together detect motion and upon halting, identify the top surface through gravity and illuminate light-emitting diodes for a striking effect. By applying 3D printing of structural electronics to expedite prototyping, the development cycle was reduced from weeks to hours.},

abstract = {Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) simultaneously coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) was developed as an original technique to study the thermal modification/degradation of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) through in depth analysis of the evolved gas. Perfectly well-defined PCL samples with controlled end groups, predictable molecular weight, and narrow molecular weight distribution were synthesized by living "coordination-insertion" ring-opening polymerization of epsilon-caprolactone initiated by aluminum triisopropoxide. TGA analyses carried out on purified PCL samples, deprived from any residual catalyst or monomer, highlighted a two-step thermal degradation. Evolved gas analysis by both MS and FTIR showed that the first process implies a statistical rupture of the polyester chains via ester pyrolysis reaction. The produced gases were identified as H(2)O, CO(2), and 5-hexenoic acid. The second step leads to the formation of epsilon-caprolactone (cyclic monomer) as result of an unzipping depolymerization process. The influence of parameters such as polyester molecular weight, nature of the PCL end groups, and presence of catalytic residues as well as the type of purge gas were investigated. The activation energy of the thermal degradation was also studied.},

abstract = {Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) at low loading levels were shown to reinforce a photocurable coating resulting in improved adhesion. A polyether polyol containing CNC at loading levels of up to 1.8 wt{\%} was grafted with 3-isopropenyl-$\alpha$,$\alpha$-dimethylbenzyl isocyanate to functionalize it with a photocurable group. The nanoparticles were kinetically stabilized in the rapidly forming prepolymer of high viscosity. Photoinitiators and a difunctional reactive diluent were added to produce optically transparent coatings and free films upon irradiation by ultraviolet (UV) light. This allowed evaluation of the effects of CNC at low loading levels in a glassy polymer matrix obtained through a rapid cure system. Incorporation of CNC nanoparticles in the polymer matrix resulted in an average improvement in adhesive strength of 154{\%} while enhancing tensile strength by an average of 16{\%}. The technique described could be used as a new approach to reduce adhesive failure in UV-curable coatings without sacrificing their mechanical strength.},

abstract = {Brownian coagulation is the most important inter-particle mechanism affecting the size distribution of aerosols. Analytical solutions to the governing population balance equation (PBE) remain a challenging issue. In this work, we develop an analytical model to solve the PBE under Brownian coagulation based on the Taylor-expansion method of moments. The proposed model has a clear advantage over conventional asymptotic models in both precision and efficiency. We first analyze the geometric standard deviation (GSD) of aerosol size distribution. The new model is then implemented to determine two analytic solutions, one with a varying GSD and the other with a constant GSD. The varying solution traces the evolution of the size distribution, whereas the constant case admits a decoupled solution for the zero and second moments. Both solutions are confirmed to have the same precision as the highly reliable numerical model, implemented by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm, and the analytic model requires significantly less computational time than the numerical approach. Our results suggest that the proposed model has great potential to replace the existing numerical model, and is thus recommended for the study of physical aerosol characteristics, especially for rapid predictions of haze formation and evolution.},

Results indicated that with more negative electrode potential, the polymerization rate increased until the mass transport limitation was reached. However, reduction of the catalyst loading had adverse effects on polymerization behaviors, such as decreased polymerization rate and increased molecular weight distributions (M/Mn). In addition, a kinetic model based on the method of moments was also constructed to explain the mismatch in Mn and Mn,theo" Simulation results showed that slow initiation significantly influenced on the kinetic behaviors in this system.

Cellulose is biorenewable and biodegradable as well as a stiff material with a relatively low specific weight, foreseen to be an excellent replacement for synthetic materials. By utilising ROP of monomers such as -caprolactone or l-lactide from cellulose, composite materials with new and/or improved properties can be obtained. Grafting of solid cellulose substrates, such as cotton, microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) or cellulose nanocrystals, renders cellulose that can easily be dispersed into polymer matrices and may be used as reinforcing elements to improve mechanical and/or barrier properties of biocomposites. A surface grafted polymer can also tailor the interfacial properties between a matrix and the fibrillar structure of cellulose. When derivatives of cellulose are grafted with polymers in homogenous media, amphiphilic materials with interesting properties can be achieved, anticipated to be utilised for applications such as encapsulation and release. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

But it lacks some of the versatile properties of synthetic polymers like compatibility, melt-processability and solubility. To mitigate these drawbacks or to produce new sustainable products, chemical modification of cellulose becomes necessary in most cases. Introduction of synthetic polymers with specific properties onto cellulose via radiation-induced grafting is one of the key approaches to modify its physical and chemical properties. Utilizing reversible-deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) methods in radiation induced grafting may provide unique opportunities to tailor the surface properties of cellulose by controlling the graft length and architecture. Nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) is of prime importance as it constitutes a bridge between nanoscience and natural cellulosic resources. The modification of this nanomaterial via radiation-induced grafting approach represents a striking potential to be explored by academy and industry. In this article it is intended to highlight the recent works on the modification of cellulose and nanocellulose via radiation-induced graft copolymerization by conventional and RDRP methods. 2},

abstract = {Enzymatic ring-opening polymerization of epsilon-caprolactone by various lipases was investigated in toluene at various temperatures. The determination of molecular weight and structural identification was carried out with gel permeation chromatography and proton NMR, respectively. Among the various lipases employed, an immobilized lipase from Candida antartica B (Novozym 435) showed the highest catalytic activity. The polymerization of epsilon-caprolactone by Novozym 435 showed an optimal temperature of 65 degrees C and an optimum toluene content of 50/50 v/v of toluene and epsilon-caprolactone. As lipases can degrade polyesters, a maximum in the molecular weight with time was obtained due to the competition of ring opening polymerization and degradation by specific chain end scission. The optimum temperature, toluene content, and the variation of molecular weight with time are consistent with earlier observations. A comprehensive model based on continuous distribution kinetics was developed to model these phenomena. The model accounts for simultaneous polymerization, degradation and enzyme deactivation and provides a technique to determine the rate coefficients for these processes. The dependence of these rate coefficients with temperature and monomer concentration is also discussed.},

The results show that the tensile strength (TS) of the pure ABS made by FDM was just up to 70{\%} of the value obtained from the injection-molded specimens. The mechanical anisotropy of the pure ABS samples was very evident when the building orientation was changed. However, we found that the addition of nanofillers significantly reduced the mechanical anisotropy and improved the mechanical strength and thermostability of the ABS samples fabricated by FDM technology.

Blockchain technology often causes controversies surrounding its application potential and business ramifications. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer network of information technology that keeps records of digital asset transactions using distributed ledgers that are free from control by intermediaries such as banks and governments. Thus, it can mitigate risks associated with intermediaries' interventions, including hacking, compromised privacy, vulnerability to political turmoil, costly compliance with government rules and regulation, instability of financial institutions, and contractual disputes. This article unlocks the mystique of blockchain technology and discusses ways to leverage blockchain technology to enhance supply chain resilience in times of increased risks and uncertainty.},

abstract = {Abstract si-RAFT polymerization is widely used for surface modification. However, how the surface radicals terminate requires further elucidation. A kinetic model is developed for si-RAFT via the R group approach. The model describes the molecular weight of grafted polymers as well as polymer layer thickness and various chain concentrations. It is shown that surface/surface radical termination plays an important role. The termination is facilitated by the migration of surface radicals through ?hopping? and ?rolling? mechanisms. ?Hopping? occurs through activation/deactivation cycles between surface and solution chains, dependent on the RAFT concentration in solution. ?Rolling? occurs through transfers between surface/surface chains, dependent on the grafting density at surface.},

The materials for novel wound dressings should have a set of features that will contribute to efficient skin recovery. The use of bacterial cellulose (BC) is attractive for advanced wound management because of the favorable characteristics of BC, such as its biocompatibility, non-toxicity, mechanical stability, and high moisture content. Numerous approaches can be taken to modify BC to address the shortcomings of the native material and to optimize its biocompatibility, water uptake and release, and antimicrobial activity. This review highlights possible pathways for functionalization of BC, affecting all levels of its structural organization. The focus is on post-production treatment of BC, although selected studies concerning in situ modifications during the biosynthesis process are also emphasized.},

abstract = {Stereolithography (SLA) is a well-established additive manufacturing (AM) technique that allows a resin to be photopolymerized into high resolution parts with rapid production times. Vanillin, a naturally occurring molecule as well as a derivative easily obtained from biomass, including lignin, can be used as a building block for vinyl ester resins (VERs) and AM-ready materials. A vanillin-based VER, prepared via a 100{\%} atom efficient and solventless technique, was investigated for AM applications due to its low viscosity and demonstrated ability to photopolymerize. The resin was additively manufactured via SLA and the effect of postprocessing after printing was investigated. The extent of cure between the printed and postprocessed samples was found to have the highest effect on polymer properties, increasing extent of cure by approximately 23{\%}. With postprocessing, the printed material was shown to have a glass transition temperature ({\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) of 153 °C and Young's modulus of 4900 MPa, comparable to the same resin cured via traditional thermal techniques.

Furthermore, the resin system also has potential as a formulation base for tunable SLA cure characteristics and final desired printed polymer properties while retaining significant biobased content.},

Data collected for low values of the monomer/initiator (M/I) ratio showed that the DL-lactide ring was opened to yield lactyl octoate-terminated short chains. A cationic-type mechanism involving co-initiation by octanoic acid was proposed to account for experimental findings. The formation of a side product, hydroxytin(II) lactate (HTL), was found which appeared able to initiate lactide polymerization and to yield a high molecular weight PLA50 polymer. However the polymerization with stannous octoate was faster than the HTL one. Anyhow, data suggested that both SnOct(2) and HTL are likely to act simultaneously as initiators during the polymerization of lactides in the presence of SnOct(2). A complete reaction scheme was proposed to account for the presence of the various compounds likely to be formed under these conditions. (C) 1997 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {PLA is one of the most promising bio-compostable and bio-degradable thermoplastic polymers made from renewable sources. PLA is generally produced by ring opening polymerization (ROP) of lactide using the metallic/bimetallic catalyst (Sn, Zn, and Al) or other organic catalysts in a suitable solvent. In this work, reactive extrusion experiments using stannous octoate Sn(Oct)2 and tri-phenyl phosphine (PPh)3 were considered to perform ROP of lactide. Ultrasound energy source was used for activating and/or boosting the polymerization as an alternative energy (AE) source. Ludovic{\textregistered} software, designed for simulation of the extrusion process, had to be modified in order to simulate the reactive extrusion of lactide and for the application of an AE source in an extruder. A mathematical model for the ROP of lactide reaction was developed to estimate the kinetics of the polymerization process. The isothermal curves generated through this model were then used by Ludovic software to simulate the “reactive” extrusion process of ROP of lactide. Results from the experiments and simulations were compared to validate the simulation methodology. It was observed that the application of an AE source boosts the polymerization of lactide monomers. However, it was also observed that the predicted residence time was shorter than the experimental one. There is potentially a case for reducing the residence time distribution (RTD) in Ludovic{\textregistered} due to the ‘liquid' monomer flow in the extruder. Although this change in parameters resulted in validation of the simulation, it was concluded that further research is needed to validate this assumption.},

Abstract: With the development of cellulose chemistry and processing technology, the applications of cellulose materials were not limited to traditional fields as engineering materials in forest originated products, paper, and textile industries, but also used for advanced functional applications in the field of biomedical and smart health care, printed electronics, and responsive wearable textiles. With the advantage of sophisticated geometry fabrication and low cost production, 3D printing technologies have been employed with many materials for a variety of applications. This critical review focuses specifically on the development and assessment of cellulose materials for 3D printing. A special focus was paid on extrusion based 3D printing. Detailed examinations of cellulose hydrogel rheology, fiber entanglement, fiber alignment, gelation, printability, shape fidelity, cell viability and processing parameters in extrusion based 3D printing are explored. Other 3D printing techniques such as inkjet 3D printing, 3D spinning, stereolithography, laminated object manufacturing and selective laser sintering are also introduced. The functionality of 3D printed constructs was designed either by cellulose surface modification or by incorporation of functional components. The properties and performances of 3D printed cellulose constructs as well as their potential applications in the fields of medical, electronics, and smart textile are discussed. Finally, perspective and current important limitations of 3D printing with cellulose materials for advanced application are provided.},

FT-IR analyses in real time and photorheology tests allowed finding the best composition and printing parameters. Printing conditions were adjusted to get 3D structures from formulations with a content up to 0.3 wt {\%} of CNTs. The presence of the filler causes a decrease of the crosslinking density, which could be overcome using higher intensity light sources.

abstract = {MoVTeNb mixed oxide, a highly active and selective catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to produce ethylene, exhibits the so-called M1 and M2 crystalline phases. The thermal stability of the MoVTeNb catalytic system was assessed under varying reaction conditions; to this end, the catalyst was exposed to several reaction temperatures spanning from 440 to 550 °C. Both the pristine and spent materials were analyzed by several characterization techniques. The catalyst was stable below 500 °C; a reaction temperature of ≥500 °C brings about the removal of tellurium from the intercalated framework channels of the M1 crystalline phase. Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction patterns and microscopy results showed that the tellurium loss causes the progressive partial destruction of the M1 phase, thus decreasing the number of active sites and forming a MoO2 crystalline phase, which is inactive for this reaction. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the MoO2 phase development as a function of reaction temperature. From high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses it was noticed that tellurium departure occurs preferentially from the end sides of the needlelike M1 crystals, across the [001] plane. Detailed analysis of a solid deposited at the reactor outlet showrf that it consisted mainly of metallic tellurium, suggesting that the tellurium detachment occurs via reduction of Te4+ to Te0 due to a combination of reaction temperature and feed composition. Thus, in order to sustain the catalytic performance exhibited by MoVTeNb mixed oxide, hot spots along the reactor bed should be avoided or controlled, maintaining the catalytic bed temperature below 500 °C. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

Since each layer is constructed from a serial of lines, the scanning parameters, especially scanning speed and hatch gap, will influence the overall light intensity which determines the layer thickness, section shape and ultimately the prototyping accuracy. The driving system, due to the non-uniform moving speeds, could cause the shape error of the lines. A light shutter, keeping the light only illuminating on resin surface within given curing areas, is employed to solve this deficiency.},

Despite various challenges associated with lignin valorization, several strategies have emerged that could deliver value-added products in good yields. The present contribution aims to critically review recent advancements in biological, thermochemical and electrochemical strategies for lignin depolymerization mainly focusing on enzymatic, acid/base/metal-catalyzed, and microwave-assisted degradation approaches. All lignin degradation strategies result in the production of an arsenal of several monomeric, oligomeric and polymeric compounds, with no single molecule being produced in significant amount. For large-scale production of biofuels and other value-added chemicals via lignin depolymerization, the combination of two or more technologies with low cost and recyclable catalysts operating at mild reaction conditions needs to be explored.},

abstract = {Properties of polymer based nanocomposites reply on distribution, concentration, geometry and property of nanofillers in polymer matrix. Increasing the concentration of carbon based nanomaterials, such as CNTs, in polymer matrix often results in stronger but more brittle material. Here, we demonstrated the first three-dimensional (3D) printed graphene oxide complex structures by stereolithography with good combination of strength and ductility. With only 0.2{\%} GOs, the tensile strength is increased by 62.2{\%} and elongation increased by 12.8{\%}. Transmission electron microscope results show that the GOs were randomly aligned in the cross section of polymer. We investigated the strengthening mechanism of the 3D printed structure in terms of tensile strength and Young's modulus. It is found that an increase in ductility of the 3D printed nanocomposites is related to increase in crystallinity of GOs reinforced polymer. Compression test of 3D GOs structure reveals the metal-like failure model of GOs nanocomposites.},

abstract = {The aim of this work is to produce fully biodegradable nanocomposite filaments with improved thermo-mechanical properties, to be used in fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing process. At this aim, nanocomposites consisting of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) containing various amounts (from 2 to 20 wt{\%}) of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) were produced by solution mixing, grinded and extruded into filaments by a single screw extruder. The obtained nanocomposite filaments were then used to feed a desktop 3D printer. In both filaments and 3D printed specimens, CNC promoted a progressive enhancement of thermal stability manifested in an increase of the glass transition temperature measured by differential scanning calorimetry. Moreover, both dynamic storage and loss moduli were also increased proportionally to the filler content, and a positive reduction of the creep compliance was observed. For a CNC content of 10 wt{\%} the creep compliance at a given loading time (one hour) decreased in both filament (by 47{\%}) and in 3D printed samples (by 35{\%}) in comparison to neat PVOH. Ultimate mechanical properties of filaments also increased with the introduction of CNC till 10 wt{\%}, with a maximum reinforcement effect observed at 2 wt{\%} of CNC for which an increase of 81{\%} in the values of tensile energy to break and 45{\%} in the stress at break were observed. An enhancement in tensile properties was observed also for 3D printed samples at 5 wt{\%} of CNC for which the stress at break manifested an improvement of 73{\%}. Adhesion between layers in 3D printed parts resulted to play a major role in the fracture behavior.},

abstract = {The microstructure of CNC particles depends strongly on the drying method employed during manufacturing. The effect of different drying techniques, including spray drying, freeze drying, and spray freeze drying (SFD), on microstructure of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) particles was studied. Conventional drying methods (i.e. spray and freeze drying) yielded packed and dense agglomerates of CNC. Capillary forces and ice crystal growth play key roles in CNC aggregation during spray and freeze drying, respectively. It was found that, in the absence of these forces, in the SFD technique, the dispersed state of CNC in water could be frozen in. Thus, SFD of CNC suspension resulted in a powder with porous structure. A filament-like agglomerate structure consisting of nanofibers was formed at low CNC concentrations (ca. {\textless}. 2. wt.{\%}), while a spherical foam structure was obtained at higher CNC concentrations. Polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites containing spray dried CNC, freeze dried CNC, and spray freeze dried CNC (CNCSFD) were prepared via melt mixing in an internal batch mixer. Optical light and scanning electron microscopy coupled with rheological properties showed better dispersion of CNCSFD agglomerates. Moreover, PP samples containing CNCSFD showed significant increases in mechanical properties. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {MoVTe(Sb)NbO catalysts have been prepared using the slurry method and tested as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The influence of both the addition of silica to the starting slurry during the preparation and of a final heat treatment under nitrogen at 873 K after the dissolution of the M2 phase formed concomitantly to the active M1 active phase has been studied. While the parameters change the texture of the catalysts without modification of the catalytic sites, they have opposite effects on catalytic properties. The addition of silica increases the conversion without modifying the selectivity to ethylene and the final heat treatment decreases the conversion but increases the selectivity. These effects have been explained respectively by a decrease of the agglomeration and sintering of the M1 phase crystallites and a decrease of the number of small pores, where total oxidation takes place. These effects could be leveraged to optimize the preparation protocol and obtain more efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Several recent research efforts have focused on use of computer-aided additive fabrication technologies, commonly referred to as additive manufacturing, rapid prototyping, solid freeform fabrication, or three-dimensional printing technologies, to create structures for tissue engineering. For example, scaffolds for tissue engineering may be processed using rapid prototyping technologies, which serve as matrices for cell ingrowth, vascularization, as well as transport of nutrients and waste. Stereolithography is a photopolymerization-based rapid prototyping technology that involves computer-driven and spatially controlled irradiation of liquid resin. This technology enables structures with precise microscale features to be prepared directly from a computer model. In this review, use of stereolithography for processing trimethylene carbonate, polycaprolactone, and poly(D,L-lactide) poly(propylene fumarate)-based materials is considered. In addition, incorporation of bioceramic fillers for fabrication of bioceramic scaffolds is reviewed. Use of stereolithography for processing of patient-specific implantable scaffolds is also discussed. In addition, use of photopolymerization-based rapid prototyping technology, known as two-photon polymerization, for production of tissue engineering scaffolds with smaller features than conventional stereolithography technology is considered.},

It is shown, on the basis of the pertinent kinetic data and MALDI-TOF evidence, that polymerization of cyclic esters initiated by Sn(Oct)(2) in the presence of ROH as coinitiator proceeds on the tin(II) alkoxide (...-Sn-OR) active centres. Sn(OC4N9)(2) initiator behaves as other covalent metal alkoxides, i.e.: initiation is fast and quantitative, every alkoxide group in Sn(OC4H9)(2) starts growth of one macromolecule, and monomer addition proceeds with the acyl-oxygen bond scission. Polymerization in the LA/Sn(OC4H9)(2) system is a living process and can be controlled in st wide range of molar masses, from M-n, = 10(3) to 10(6).

Owing to their high aspect ratio, stiffness, and reinforcing potential, CNCs have shown great promise to be used in polymer nanocomposites. However, due to their inherent hydrophilicity and compatibility with polar environments, the use of CNCs in hydrophobic polymer matrices or in organic solvent-based formulations has been limited. To overcome this incompatibility, many reports on grafting polymers onto the surface of CNCs have been published over the past ten years. This review describes the recent advances in CNC surface functionalization through polymer grafting, and comprehensively covers the existing work to date. Methods including polymer “grafting to” and “grafting from” are described in detail, using polymerization techniques such as free radical, ring opening, and controlled radical polymerization. Purification and characterization of polymer-grafted CNCs, the potential for upscaling these functionalization methods, and current perspectives from academic and industrial viewpoints are presented.},

Due to small diffusion paths inside a nanosized particle impurities can be efficiently removed in a reactive atmosphere. This is state of the art for the preparation of high-purity glasses for optical fibers. Alternatively, all kinds of dopings can be added to the compact before sintering. Of special interest are functional nanosized particles, which can be incorporated into the compact through the open pores. The starting materials used were made by flame hydrolysis. Commercially available at a low price are silica glass powders (8...40 nm in size), alumina, zirconia and titania (typ. 20...30 nm in size). These powders are well suited for the preparation of advanced materials because they are non-porous and spherical. For additional applications, especially in the field of coatings, pure silica powders are not sufficient due to the small thermal expansion coefficient. Therefore the flame hydrolysis process was modified and multicomponent (e.g. SiO2, B2O3, Na2O, Al2O3) nanosized glass powders were prepared. Compacts of these powders can be sintered to transparent coatings at temperatures down to 650 °C.},

abstract = {Phase-pure M1 catalysts with different post-treatments have been prepared from the same precursor slurry by hydrothermal synthesis and used to study the key factors influencing their performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) process. Different purification processes (i.e. steam treatment and hydrogen peroxide treatment) result in different tellurium (Te) contents and V5+ concentration in the catalysts. Catalytic tests reveal that there is a direct correlation between the amount of V5+ present in the catalysts and the catalytic activity. A hydrogen peroxide treatment increases the V5+concentration and decreases the Te content which can improve the catalytic activity and stability in comparison with the steam treatment. A post-treatment with oxalic acid improves the catalyst surface area (54 m2/g) but causes some vanadium leaching. The phase-pure M1 catalyst calcined at 650 °C and purified by H2O2 shows the best catalyst productivity of 0.77 kgC2H4/kgcat/h at 73{\%} ethane conversion and 85{\%} ethylene selectivity in ODHE process. The formation of reduced Te(0) aggregates blocking the active sites is identified as a main reason for catalyst deactivation. A low Te content favors a stable catalyst with less risk of Te aggregation. However, at harsh operating conditions (i.e. high oxygen concentration and high reactor temperature) the performance of phase-pure M1 catalysts with a low Te content can also reduce obviously due to the formation of a new (V, Nb)-substituted $\theta$-Mo5O14 and MoO2 phases.},

abstract = {Following our previous papers on the mechanism of epsilon-caprolactone (CL) and l,l-lactide (LA) polymerization initiated by tin(II) octoate (tin(II) bis(2-ethylhexanoate), (Sn(Oct)2) in the presence of the hydroxyl-group-containing compounds H2O, alcohols or hydroxy-carboxylic acids (ROH) the present work shows that the CL or LA/Sn(Oct)2/primary amine (RNH2) system, in principle, does not differ mechanistically from the CL or LA/Sn(Oct)2/ROH system. 1H NMR, matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometric and kinetic studies reveal that, in the first step of polymerization initiated with the Sn(Oct)2/RNH2 mixtures, formation of the alpha-amido-omega-alcohol (RNH-m-H (R`OH)) (in which m denotes the repeating unit derived from CL or LA) proceeds. Then, the further steps of polymerization follow with R`OH as co-initiator. Thus, eventually, the Sn(Oct)2/RNH2-initiated polymerization proceeds by the monomer insertion into the ...-SnOR` bond, reversibly formed in the reaction: ...-SnOct + R` `OH {\^{a}}{\OE} ...-SnOR` + OctH, in which R` `OH is either the low-molar-mass co-initiator (R`OH) or a macromolecule fitted with the hydroxyl end group (RNH-(m)n-H); OctH stands for 2-ethylhexanoic (octanoic) acid. These interconversions take place throughout the entire polymerization process. The Sn(Oct)2/amino dendrimer (e.g., commercially available DABAm-8 and DABAm-32, polyamines, fitted with 8 and 32 primary amino groups) system acts in a similar way. Molar masses of the resulting star-shaped polymer, in which polyester chains bear the hydroxyl end groups, are controlled by the monomer and dendrimer concentrations ratio in the feed.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology enables decentralization as new forms of distributed software architectures, where components can reach agreements on the shared system states without trusting on a central integration point. Since blockchain is an emerging technology which is still at an early stage of development, there is limited experience on applying blockchain to real-world software applications. We applied blockchain application design approaches proposed in software architecture community in a real-world project called originChain, which is a blockchain-based traceability system that restructures the current system by replacing the central database with blockchain. In this paper, we share our experience of building originChain. By using blockchain and designing towards security, originChain provides transparent tamper-proof traceability data with high availability and enables automated regulatory-compliance checking and adaptation in product traceability scenarios. We also demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the software architecture of originChain. Based on our experience and analysis, we found that the structural design of smart contracts has large impact on the quality of the system.},

abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of the natural origin polymers that are commercially available or currently being studied in different laboratories for tissue engineering applications, with some emphasis on the most widely studied systems. It describes their chemical structure, main properties, and potential applications within the field. The chapter helps in understanding the origin, structure, and properties of natural polymers used in tissue engineering applications. It identifies the characteristics that make natural polymers interesting for TE applications. Natural polymers are derived from renewable resources, namely from plants, animals and microorganisms, and are, therefore, widely distributed in nature. These materials exhibit a large diversity of unique rather complex structures. Tissue engineering offers the possibility to help in the regeneration of tissues damaged by disease or trauma and, in some cases, to create new tissues and replace failing or malfunctioning organs. Typically, this is achieved through the use of degradable biomaterials to either induce surrounding tissue and cell ingrowth or to serve as temporary scaffolds for transplanted cells to attach, grow, and maintain differentiated functions. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The development of biocompatible polymer nano-composites that enhance mechanical properties while maintaining thermoplastic processability is a longstanding goal in sustainable materials. When the matrix is semi-crystalline, the nanoparticles may induce significant changes to crystallization kinetics and morphology due to their ability to act as nucleating agents. To fully model this behavior in a process line, an understanding of the relationship between crystallinity and modulus is required. Here, we introduce a scalable model system consisting of surface-compatibilized cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) dispersed into poly($\epsilon$-caprolactone) (PCL) and study the effects of nanoparticle concentration on isothermal crystallization kinetics. The dispersion is accomplished by exchange of the Na+ of sulfated cellulose nanocrystals by tetra-butyl ammonium cations (Bu4N+) followed by melt mixing via twin-screw extrusion. Crystallization kinetics are measured through the recently developed rheo-Raman instrument which extracts the relationship between the growth of the transient mechanical modulus and that of crystallinity. With extrusion and increasing CNC content, we find the expected enhancement of crystallization rate, but we moreover find a significant change in the relative kinetics of increase in modulus versus crystallinity. We analyze this via generalized effective medium theory which allows computation of a critical percolation threshold $\xi$c and discuss the results in terms of a change in nucleation density and a change in the anisotropy of crystallization.},

abstract = {Fabrication of low-cost, durable and efficient metal oxide nanocomposites were successfully synthesized and reinforced with photo-resin via 3-dimensional printing. Here, we put forward a novel approach to enhance the mechanical and thermal behaviors of stereolithography (SLA) 3D printed architecture by adding TiO2 nanoparticles (TNPs) in different crystalline phases (anatase and rutile), which were obtained at different annealing temperatures from 400 °C to 1000°C. The heat-treated anatase TNPs were scrutinized by X-ray diffraction(XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, diffusive reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. Among all the samples, at 800 °C, annealed anatase TNPs exposed a highly crystalline anatase phase, having a low energy bandgap and a comparably high tensile strength (47.43 MPa) and high elastic modulus (2.261 GPa) for the 3D printed samples, showing improvement by 103{\%} and 32{\%}, respectively, compared with the printed pristine stereolithography resin (SLR) sample. Moreover, enhanced storage modulus and tan $\delta$ values were achieved via the better interfacial interactions between the incorporated nanofillers and the SLR matrix. In addition to this, enhanced thermal conductivity and thermal stability of the SLR matrix were also noted. The low energy bandgap and nanoscale size of the fillers helped to achieve good dispersion and allowed the UV light to penetrate at a maximum depth through the photo resin.},

abstract = {Novel photopolymerizable nanocomposite formulations, able to photopolymerize with a dual curing mechanism (cationic and radical), were developed, characterized and used in the stereolithography (SL) process for the construction of 3D objects with a very simple geometry. The influence of the presence of organically modified montmorillonite (OM) nanoparticles on the reactivity of the photopolymerizable liquid mixtures was firstly analyzed, as function of the amount of nanofiller, by photocalorimetric analysis (p-DSC). The basal distance of OM before and after mixing with the photocurable formulation was characterized by X-ray diffraction. Composites with higher content of OM show an intercalated structure. An exfoliated structure was instead observed in the composites with the lowest OM content, after photocuring in the SL apparatus. These results were also confirmed by the morphological analysis performed by SEM. The glass transition temperature of nanocomposites, photocured by stereolithography, was finally measured by TMA and DSC techniques, confirming that the photocurable formulation loaded with the lowest amount of OM presents improved properties than the unloaded formulation.

abstract = {Photo-curable resins based on multifunctional acrylate monomers are commonly applied as thin films (e.g. protective coatings, printing inks, etc.) and in recent years are also used for the fabrication of bulk objects such as dental fillings and 3D-printed parts. While rapid curing and good spatial resolution are advantages to these systems, brittleness and poor impact resistance due to inhomogeneous polymer architecture and high crosslink density are serious drawbacks. By comparison, epoxy thermoset resins suffered many years ago from similar problems, but since then are found in ever demanding applications thanks to a variety of approaches to increase polymer toughness. Based on these successes, researchers have tried to translate strategies for toughening epoxy resins to photopolymer networks. Therefore, this review surveys relevant scientific papers and patents on the development of crosslinked epoxy-based polymers and also photo-curable polymers based on multifunctional acrylates with improved toughness. Strategies developed to reduce brittleness include working with monomers, which intrinsically give tougher polymers, particulate additives, and alternate forms of polymerization and polymer architecture (e.g., dual-cure networks, interpenetrating networks, thiol-ene chemistry). All of these strategies have advantages and yet application specific rigours must also be considered before and during formulation development.},

abstract = {Polydispersity quantifies the breadth of polymer molecular weight distribution, making it an important and frequently quoted chain microstructural property for characterization. An explicit expression of such an important variable is desirable for ease of calculation, correlation with experiment data, and/or parameter estimation. A review of published literatures shows that great efforts have been put forth by many researchers to derive these equations for various polymerization mechanisms. In atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), polydispersity depends on three factors: monomer conversion, number of monomer addition per activation/deactivation cycle, and amount of dead chains. The existing expressions available in the literature only account for, at most, two of these three factors, with the contribution from dead chains commonly neglected. This assumption results in polydispersity monotonically decreasing with conversion, which is often not observed in experiments. In this work, a new equation for polydispersity, which accounts for contributions of all the three aforementioned factors, is proposed. The validity of assumptions involved in the derivation is evaluated by comparing the polydispersity profiles to those simulated by the method of moments. In addition, this new equation is used to correlate several experiment data sets for verification, namely from ATRP of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, methyl methacrylate, and N-isopropylacrylamide, showing better agreement than the existing equation.

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is poised to transform human life and unleash enormous economic benefit. However, inadequate data security and trust of current IoT are seriously limiting its adoption. Blockchain, a distributed and tamper-resistant ledger, maintains consistent records of data at different locations, and has the potential to address the data security concern in IoT networks. While providing data security to the IoT, Blockchain also encounters a number of critical challenges inherent in the IoT, such as a huge number of IoT devices, non-homogeneous network structure, limited computing power, low communication bandwidth, and error-prone radio links. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on existing Blockchain technologies with an emphasis on the IoT applications. The Blockchain technologies which can potentially address the critical challenges arising from the IoT and hence suit the IoT applications are identified with potential adaptations and enhancements elaborated on the Blockchain consensus protocols and data structures. Future research directions are collated for effective integration of Blockchain into the IoT networks.},

abstract = {Investigations of the kinetics of zwitterionic ring-opening polymerization of $\epsilon$-caprolactone by N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) were carried out to illuminate the key reaction steps responsible for the formation of high molecular weight cyclic poly(caprolactones). Modeling of both the decay in monomer concentration as well as the evolution of molecular weights and polydispersities were necessary to identify the key reaction steps responsible for initiation, propagation, cyclization and chain-transfer. Nucleophilic attack of the NHC on $\epsilon$-caprolactone to generate reactive zwitterions is slow and reversible. The modeling indicates that less than 60{\%} of the carbenes are transformed to active zwitterions, but that these zwitterions rapidly add monomer and cyclize by intramolecular backbiting of the terminal alkoxides on internal esters of the zwitterions. This cyclization event maintains the concentration of active zwitterions. The reactivation of cyclized chains by active zwitterions is a key step that leads to high molecular weight poly(caprolactones).},

@article{Butte1999,
abstract = {Abstract The molecular weight distribution (MWD) of a branched polymer has been calculated by using approximate techniques based on the partition of the overall polymer chain population into classes according to molecular dimension or the number of branches. These techniques are especially useful in segregated systems, such as emulsion polymerization, where rigorous methods are too onerous. A comparison with the correct MWD obtained through a detailed solution method has shown that, of these techniques, ?numerical fractionation? predicts in some cases a marked shoulder at the high molecular weights that does not exist in the true MWD. On the other hand, besides offering an intelligent description of gel formation, ?numerical fractionation? permits to calculate quickly the correct average molecular weights and constitutes a significant improvement compared to the classical method of moments when a complete MWD is required. In the latter case, however, the most accurate approximate technique has been found to be based on the subdivision of the polymer chains according to the number of branches. This technique, though more time-consuming than ?numerical fractionation?, provides also the branching distribution along with the MWD. A quick method is suggested to estimate the minimum number of branches required by this technique to calculate the correct complete MWD.},

The introduction of surface amine functionality to the cellulose nanocrystal allowed for an additional reaction with a biobased epoxy resin derived from diphenolic acid. The resulting thermomechanical properties of epoxy nanocomposites with amine functionalized cellulose nanocrystal were on average more than 7 times improved.

abstract = {Abstract The moment equations for binary copolymerization in the context of the terminal model have been solved numerically for a batch reactor operating over a wide range of conditions. Calculated number- and weight-average molecular weights were compared with those found using pseudo-kinetic rate constants with the method of moments and with the instantaneous property method for homopolymerization. With the pseudo-kinetic rate constant method under polymerization conditions where number-average molecular weights (M?n) are below about 103 the error in calculating M?n exceeds 5{\%}. The error increases rapidly with decrease in molecular weight for M?n {\textless} 103. M?n measured experimentally for polymer chains (homo- and copolymers) have error limits of greater than ±5{\%} at the 95{\%} confidence level. Therefore, for all practical purposes, the pseudo-kinetic rate constant method is valid for M?n greater than 103. Errors in calculating weight-average molecular weights (M?w) or higher averages are always smaller than those for M?n when applying the pseudo-kinetic rate constant method. The assumptions involved in molecular weight modelling using the pseudo-kinetic rate constant approach are thus proven to be valid, and therefore it is recommended that the pseudo-kinetic rate constant method be employed with the instantaneous property method to calculate the full molecular weight distribution and averages for linear chains synthesized by multicomponent chain growth polymerization.},

@article{Zhu1999a,
abstract = {Abstract A kinetic model has been developed for atom transfer radical polymerization processes using the method of moments. This model predicts monomer conversion, number-average molecular weight and polydispersity of molecular weight distribution. It takes into account the effects of side reactions including bimolecular radical termination and chain transfers. The determining parameters include the ratios of the initiator, catalyst and monomer concentrations, as well as the ratios of the rate constants of propagation, termination, transfer and the equilibrium constant between radicals and their dormant species. The effects of these parameters on polymer chain properties are systematically simulated. The results show that an ideal living radical polymerization exhibiting a linear relationship between number-average molecular weight versus conversion and polydispersity approaching unity is only achievable under the limiting condition of slow monomer propagation and free of radical termination and transfers. Improving polymerization rate usually accompanies a loss of this linearity and small polydispersity. For polymerization systems having a slow initiation, the dormant species exercise a retention effect on chain growing and tend to narrow the molecular weight distribution. Increasing catalyst concentration accelerates the initiation rate and thus decreases the polydispersities. It is also shown that for a slow initiation system, delaying monomer addition helps to reduce the polydispersities. Radical termination and transfers not only slow down the monomer conversion rates but also broaden polymer molecular weight distributions. Under the limiting conditions of fast propagation and termination and slow initiation, the model predicts the conventional free radical polymerization behaviors.},

In fact, the laser radiation of a commercial stereolithography printer was used to both selectively cure, layer by layer, the acrylic resin and to reduce a silver salt to AgNPs (having dimensions ranging between 10 and 25 nm). The most suitable formulation was developed using silver acetate to obtain 1{\%} by weight of AgNPs in the final 3D structures. The presence of the filler causes an increase in the physical and mechanical properties of the samples that become significantly stiffer and stronger than the pristine matrix. Antibacterial properties and electrical conductivity measurements performed on the printed samples gave promising results for the use of the developed formulation for the building of 3D polymeric structures with improved multifunctional properties.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Society of Photo- Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) [DOI: 10.1117/1.OE.57.4.041412]. Recent advances in material engineering have shown that renewable raw materials, such as plant oils or glycerol, can be applied for synthesis of polymers due to ready availability, inherent biodegradability, limited toxicity, and existence of modifiable functional groups and eventually resulting to a potentially lower cost. After additional chemical modifications (epoxidation, acrylation, double bonds metathesis, etc.), they can be applied in such high-tech areas as stereolithography, which allows fabrication of three-dimensional (3-D) objects. "Autodesk's" 3-D optical printer "Ember" using 405-nm light was implemented for dynamic projection lithography. It enabled straightforward spatio-selective photopolymerization on demand, which allows development of various photosensitive materials. The bio-based resins' photosensitivity was compared to standard "Autodesk" "PR48" and "Formlabs" "Clear" materials. It turned out that the bioresins need a higher energy dose to be cured (a least 16 J cm-2for a single layer varying from 100 to 130 $\mu$m). Despite this, submillimeter range 2.5-D structural features were formed, and their morphology was assessed by optical profilometer and scanning electron microscope. It was revealed that a higher exposition dose (up to 26 J cm-2) results in a linear increase in the formed structures height, proving controllability of the undergoing process. Overall, the provided results show that naturally derived resins are suitable candidates for tabletop gray-tone lithography.},

abstract = {Abstract The kinetics of polymeric network formation via free radical mechanisms is an attractive research area because there are many phenomena which are not well understood and in addition, the commercial potential for crosslinked systems is great. Recently, a large research/development program was initiated at the McMaster Institute for Polymer Production Technology (MIPPT) to investigate the fundamentals and applications of polymeric network, in particular, the kinetics of synthesis via free-radical mechanisms and network characterization. The research on crosslinking involved both theoretical developments and experimentation. Herein is provided a comprehensive summary of this work. In the experimental polymerization, two comonomers, methyl methacrylate (MMA) / ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) and acrylamide (AAm) / N,N-methylene bisacrylamide (Bis), as model systems were studied in considerable detail. Measurements included: monomer conversions, radical concentrations, sol/gel fractions, crosslink densities (equilibrium swelling and swollen-state 13C-NMR) over the entire range of divinyl monomer levels as a function of polymerization time. In the polymer modification, high density polyethylenes were crosslinked using peroxides and ?-radiation. For this system, crosslinking and chain scission occur simultaneously. In the theoretical studies, it was shown that in general, network formation by free-radical mechanisms is highly irreversible requiring that the classical equilibrium gelation theories after Flory/Stockmayer be generalized. The general model which was developed using the pseudo-kinetic rate constant method predicts the existence of a crosslink density distribution (crosslink density of a primary polymer chain depends on its birth time) with a variance which can vary widely depending on network synthesis conditions.},

Internationally recognized standardization bodies, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), as well as regional standardization bodies, such as the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), are actively involved in developing standards related to composting and biodegradation. Determination of the ultimate aerobic biodegradability of plastic materials under controlled composting conditions by analysis of evolved carbon dioxide has been presented along with several other methods, such as determination of the ultimate aerobic biodegradability of plastic materials in an aqueous medium by measuring the oxygen demand in a closed respirometer. Other methods discussed are measurement of biogas production, analysis of released biogas, and determination of the ultimate aerobic biodegradability in soil by measuring the oxygen demand in a respirometer or the amount of carbon dioxide evolved. The composting test method based on activated vermiculite was proposed as a comprehensive system for the assessment of the environmental impact of compostable polymers. Different vermiculite media were studied in order to determine the parameters of an inert solid medium which could simulate the degradation of a polymer in compost. An overview of the testing methods which have been used to evaluate biodegradability of polymers and packaging materials is presented.},

Controlled amounts of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were successfully dispersed in SL epoxy-based resins and complex three-dimensional (3D) parts were successfully fabricated by means of a modified SL setup. The effect of the nanosized filler was evaluated by means of mechanical testing. Small concentrations of MWCNTs resulted in significant effects on the physical properties of the polymerized resin. A MWCNT concentration of 0.05{\%} (w/v) increased the ultimate tensile stress and fracture stress an average of 17{\%} and 37{\%}, respectively. Increasing the MWCNT concentration to 0.5{\%} (w/v) enhanced the integrity of the nanocomposite samples over much wider operating temperatures. Sample parts were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy to measure the impact of this particular nanomaterial on the morphology of the nanocomposite samples and results showed affinity between the constituents and identified buckled nanotubes that illustrated strong interfacial bonding. These improved physical properties may provide opportunities for using nanocomposite SL resins in end-use applications.

PLA-g-CNFs/PLA composite filaments targeted for 3D printing were produced by compounding the master batch in PLA matrix and melt extrusion. The as-extruded composite filaments were subsequently thermal annealed in a conventional oven, and their morphological, thermal, and mechanical properties were evaluated. PLA was successfully grafted on the surface of CNFs as demonstrated by elemental analysis, and the concentration of grafted PLA was estimated to be 33 wt {\%}.

All-PP tapes are highly oriented and their failure behaviour follows that of other highly oriented polymers. All-PP woven composites fail ultimately due to PP tape failure. However, this failure mode is accompanied by delamination of fabrics in the woven structure. Consolidation pressure plays a decisive role in controlling the interlaminar properties and hence the delamination resistance and furthermore the fatigue limit of the composite. Comparison of all-PP woven composites with commercial alternatives based on glass and natural fibres reveals the excellent relative performance of all-PP composites under fatigue loads. Fatigue properties of all-PP composites are however sensitive to the testing temperature, and elevated temperatures can lead to a rapid reduction of the fatigue resistance of these all-polymer systems.},

abstract = {A novel 5???-deoxy-5-fluorouridine-poly(??-caprolactone) (5???-DFUR-PCL) polymer was synthesized from the antitumor agent doxifluridine (5???-DFUR) by the ring-opening polymerization of ??-caprolactone (??-CL) using Sn(II) 2-ethylhexanoate (Sn(Oct)2) as the catalyst. The structure and molecular weight of these polymers were further elucidated by proton nuclear magnetic resonance and gel-permeation chromatography. The results revealed that the molecular weights of the 5???-DFUR-PCL polymers were close to the theoretical values calculated from the ??-CL to 5???-DFUR molar ratios and their recovery yields were as high as 90{\%}. Two mechanisms of ??-CL polymerization initiated by Sn(Oct)2 were proposed involving either a single or two 5???-DFUR molecules. This study has provided an efficient method for the preparation of 5???-DFUR-PCL polymers. These novel 5???-DFUR-PCL polymers can be applied as drugs on carriers without the need for the coating or grafting processes associated with drugs in drug delivery and have great potential for cancer therapy. ?? 2008 Acta Materialia Inc.},

Nevertheless, the different groups of cyclic monomers are considered (olefins, ethers, thioethers, amines, lactones, thiolactones, lactams, disulfides, anhydrides, carbonates, silicones, phosphazenes and phosphonites) and the mechanisms by which they can be polymerized involving a ring-opening polymerization.

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

abstract = {The goal of this work was to evaluate the effect of chemical modification of cellulose nanofibers (CNF) on the properties of polylactic acid (PLA) nanocomposites. Acetylated nanofibers (ACNF), with degree of substitution 1. 07, were isolated from acetylated kenaf fibers by mechanical treatments. Acetylated nanofibers showed more hydrophobic properties compared to non-acetylated ones. The results showed that both crystallinity and thermal stability of acetylated nanofibers were lower than non-acetylated ones. The nanocomposites were prepared by premixing two PLA master batches, one with a high concentration of ACNF and the second with CNF. These were diluted to final concentrations (5 wt{\%}) during the extrusion. The morphology studies of PLA and its nanocomposites showed nanofiber aggregates in both materials. The results showed that the tensile and dynamic mechanical properties were enhanced for both acetylated and non-acetylated nanocomposites compared to the neat PLA matrix while no significant improvement was observed for the acetylated nanocomposites compared to non-acetylated ones. However, the storage modulus increased slightly for acetylated nanocomposites compared to non-acetylated ones. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Isoconversional method is not suitable to analyse pyrolysis of hemicellulose and lignin as it involves multi-step reactions. The activation energies of the main decomposition stage for cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are 199.66, 95.39, and 174.40 kJ mol−1 respectively.

abstract = {A novel family of optically transparent acrylic nanocomposites containing up to 30 wt {\%} silica nanoparticles with an average diameter of 20 nm was developed for application in structural light modulation (SLM) and stereolithography (SL) technologies. The uniform dispersion of nanoparticles affords a significantly improved toughness/stiffness-balance of the photopolymerized and postcured nanocomposites. It is possible to increase stiffness, as expressed by Young's modulus, from 1290 to 1700MPa without encountering the embrittlement typical for many other conventional filled polymers. Fracture behaviour is examined by means of fracture mechanics investigation and SEM analyses of fracture surfaces. According to TEM analyses and measurement of optical transmittance remarkable uniform dispersion of silica nanoparticles was achieved. The silica nanoparticle concentrations up to 17 wt {\%} give only marginally higher viscosities and do not affect transmittance, while slightly increasing the exposure times needed in photopolymerization. Moreover, the silica nanoparticles afford materials with reduced shrinkage and improved properties. The green effective ankle splay out (EASO) measured on H-shaped diagnostic specimens, is significantly reduced for the nanocomposite materials from 1.38 mm for the unfilled material to 0.82 mm for nanocomposites containing 30 wt {\%} nanosilica. The building accuracy is increased significantly with increasing content of silica nanofillers. {\textcopyright} 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA.},

abstract = {A multi-material stereolithography (MMSL) machine was developed by retrofitting components from a commercial 3D Systems 250/50 stereolithography (SL) machine on a separate stand-alone system and adapting the components to function with additional components required for MMSL operation. The MMSL machine required construction of a new frame and the development of a new rotating vat carousel system, platform assembly, and automatic leveling system. The overall operation of the MMSL system was managed using a custom LabVIEW {\textregistered} program, which included controlling a new vat leveling system and new linear and rotational stages, while the commercial SL control software (3D Systems Buildstation 4.0) was retained for controlling the laser scanning process. During MMSL construction, the sweeping process can be inhibited by previously cured layers, and thus, a deep-dip coating process without sweeping was used with low viscosity resins. Low viscosity resins were created by diluting commercial resins, including DSM Somos{\textregistered} WaterShed™ 11120, ProtoTherm™ 12120, and 14120 White, with propoxylated (2) neopentyl glycol diacrylate (PNGD). Several multi-material complex parts were produced providing compelling evidence that MMSL can produce unique parts that are functional, visually illustrative, and constructed with multi-materials. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The scanning electronic microscope showed that the modified CNCs homogeneously dispersed in PMMA matrix. Breaking strength and elongation at break of the composites were improved, which was attributed to the reinforcement of CNCs modified with styrene.

abstract = {This paper addresses reactor modeling and recipe optimization of semibatch ring-opening polymerization processes for making block copolymers. Two rigorous reactor models are developed on the basis of the population balance and method of moments, respectively. The complete polymerization process model also includes vapor-liquid equilibrium equations from applying Flory-Huggins theory. The accuracies of both reactor models are validated against historical plant data by adjusting model parameters such as kinetic rate constants. The recipe optimization problem is formulated to design the optimal reactor operating policy to minimize polymerization time and incorporate additional process constraints in accordance with final product properties and process safety requirements. The resulting dynamic optimization problem is translated to a nonlinear program by using the simultaneous collocation method, and further solved by the interior point method. In the case study example, both reactor models show satisfactory matches between their predictions and the historical plant data. The recipe optimization with both models demonstrates significant process improvement and reductions in batch operating time. Moreover, the moment model shows superiority over the population balance model in terms of computational efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Olefins or unsaturated hydrocarbons play a vital role as feedstock for many industrially significant processes. Ethylene is the simplest olefin and a key raw material for consumer products. Oxidative Dehydrogenation (ODH) is one of the most promising new routes for ethylene production that can offer a significant advantage in energy efficiency over the conventional steam pyrolysis process. This study is focused on the ODH chemistry using the mixed metal oxide MoVTeNbOx catalysts, generally referred to as M1 for the key phase known to be active for dehydrogenation. Using performance results from the patent literature a series of process simulations were conducted to evaluate the effect of feed composition on operating costs, profitability and process safety. The key results of this study indicate that the ODH reaction can be made safer and more profitable without use of an inert diluent and furthermore by replacing O2 with CO2 as an oxidant. Modifications of the M1 catalyst composition in order to adopt these changes are discussed.},

abstract = {Used cooking oil disposal is a concern at the global scale. Direct disposal from domestic households and restaurants via drains can result in serious environmental issues. In this study, waste cooking oil was collected directly from vats in a McDonald's restaurant and acrylated via a straightforward one-step reaction. After the addition of a photoinitiator and without any photoinhibitor, the product can be printed using a commercial 3D printer. The formulated resin produced high-resolution prints with features down to 100 micrometers. The rapid prototyped prints show considerable thermomechanical stability, morphological homogeneity, and biodegradability when compared to a state-of-the-art research resin and a commercial resin. This paper introduces the concept that waste cooking oil can be directly converted into a high-value commercial 3D-printing resin, which may have considerable societal benefits including reduction of waste and carbon emissions.},

We focused on the differences of catalytic gasification characteristics among three major biomass components. Sodium carbonate and dolomite largely positively promoted hemicellulose gasification, significantly improved the gasification efficiency, calorific value of gas, and carbon conversion, and significantly reduced the tar yield. Sodium carbonate showed the optimal catalytic effect. Dolomite positively catalyzed the gasification of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, straw, and pine. Sodium carbonate significantly catalyzed the gasification of hemicellulose, but it inhibited the gasification of cellulose, lignin, straw, and pine. Sodium carbonate is suitable to catalyze the gasification of biomass with a high content of hemicellulose. The influences of different catalysts on the catalytic gasification characteristics of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin were different. Therefore, the selection of biomass gasification catalyst should be based on the components and properties of biomass.},

abstract = {The wide range of mechanical properties, biocompatibility and biodegradability of reabsorbable polymers play important roles in the engineering process for regeneration of tissues. Among these polymers, poly-lactic acid (PLA) and its copolymers have been the most widely used because of their bioresorbable properties. PLA is produced from lactic acid, within a green production, which starts from sucrose obtained from sugarcane molasses as well as sugars derived from carbohydrate sources such as corn, wheat, potato, or cassava. In this work, lactic acid polymerization in batch process was simulated by means of ASPEN PLUS{\textregistered} (Polymer Plus) simulator. The kinetic parameters were extracted from current literature. The simulation was developed in order to represent the following stages: oligomerization, lactide formation and final polymerization. Operation conditions, including temperature, pressure and reaction time were determined in each reactor so as to predict the properties of the final product, such as molecular weight number (MWN). Regarding biomedical devices, the fabrication of scaffolds, bone fixation plates and screws requires the use of high molecular weight number PLA. Thus, this simulation allowed for the achievement of the optimal operation conditions for the production of PLA with MWN around 42000.},

abstract = {Fabrication of composite scaffolds using stereolithography (SLA) for bone tissue engineering has shown great promises. However, in order to trigger effective bone formation and implant integration, exogenous growth factors are commonly combined to scaffold materials. In this study, we fabricated biodegradable composite scaffolds using SLA and endowed them with osteopromotive properties in the absence of biologics. First we prepared photo-crosslinkable poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) resins containing 20 and 40 wt{\%} of hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles and fabricated scaffolds with controlled macro-architecture. Then, we conducted experiments to investigate how the incorporation of HA in photo-crosslinked PTMC matrices improved human bone marrow stem cells osteogenic differentiation in vitro and kinetic of bone healing in vivo. We observed that bone regeneration was significantly improved using composite scaffolds containing as low as 20 wt{\%} of HA, along with difference in terms of osteogenesis and degree of implant osseointegration. Further investigations revealed that SLA process was responsible for the formation of a rich microscale layer of HA corralling scaffolds. To summarize, this work is of substantial importance as it shows how the fabrication of hierarchical biomaterials via surface-enrichment of functional HA nanoparticles in composite polymer stereolithographic structures could impact in vitro and in vivo osteogenesis. Statement of Significance This study reports for the first time the enhance osteopromotion of composite biomaterials, with controlled macro-architecture and microscale distribution of hydroxyapatite particles, manufactured by stereolithography. In this process, the hydroxyapatite particles are not only embedded into an erodible polymer matrix, as reported so far in the literature, but concentrated at the surface of the structures. This leads to robust in vivo bone formation at low concentration of hydroxyapatite. The reported 3D self-corralling composite architecture provides significant opportunities to develop functional biomaterials for bone repair and tissue engineering.},

abstract = {Lithography-based additive manufacturing (AM) is increasingly becoming the technology of choice for the small series or single unit production. At the TU Vienna a digital light processing (DLP) system was developed for the fabrication of complex technical ceramics, requiring high levels of detail and accuracy. The DLP-system used in this study creates a ceramic green part by stacking up layers of a photo-curable resin with a solid loading of around 45vol.{\%} zirconia. After a thermal debinding and sintering step the part turns into a dense ceramic and gains its final properties. The native resolution of the DLP process depends on the light engine's DMD (digital mirror device) chip and the optics employed. Currently it is possible to print 3D-structures with a spatial resolution down to 40$\mu$m. A modification of the light source allows for the customization of the light curing strategy for each pixel of the exposed layers. This work presents methods to improve the geometrical accuracy as well as the structural properties of the final 3D-printed ceramic part by using the full capabilities of the light source. On the one hand, the feasibility to control the dimensional overgrowth to gain resolution below the native resolution of the light engine-a sub-pixel resolution-was evaluated. Overgrowth occurs due to light scattering and was found to be sensitive to both exposure time and exposed area. On the other hand, different light curing strategies (LCSs) and depths of cure (C d ) were used for the 3D-printing of ceramic green parts and their influence on cracks in the final ceramic was evaluated. It was concluded that softstart LCSs, as well as higher values for C d , reduce cracks in the final ceramic. Applying these findings within the 3D-printing process may be another step toward flawless and highly accurate ceramic parts.},

Formation of acetic acid, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide has been incorporated using a holistic reaction mechanism. The proposed model is based on two different oxygen sites, namely, lattice oxygen causing carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage and electrophilic surface oxygen responsible for the formation of carbon-oxygen bonds. It is found that carbon dioxide exclusively originates from decarboxylation of acetate species, while ethene selectively reacts to CO. Consumption and formation of all species are well predicted by the proposed model. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate the strong impact of the initial carbon-hydrogen cleavage on the net ethene production rate. Moreover, regeneration of lattice oxygen sites is found to become rate-determining at oxygen-lean conditions.},

abstract = {Stereolithography is a 3D printing technique in which a liquid monomer is photopolymerized to produce a solid object. The most widely used materials usually belong to the family of acrylate monomers, and photopolymerization occurs through a radical pathway. Photoinitiators can absorb UV or (less often) visible light, producing radicals for direct decomposition or hydrogen abstraction. Due to the toxicity of acrylates, vegetable oil-derived monomers were used in this study. In fact, vegetable oils contain unsaturations, and thus, they can be exploited as monomers. In particular, linseed oil, tung oil or edible oils (soybean, sunflower or corn) could be good candidates as raw materials. Unfortunately, the photoinduced radical polymerization of these oils either does not occur or is too slow for 3D printing applications. For this reason, the oils were modified as epoxides. Epoxides are monomers that are more reactive than natural oils, and they can be polymerized via a cationic mechanism. The aim of this work was to exploit visible light generated by a common digital projector (like those used in classrooms) as a light source. Since the tested photoacid generators working under visible light are ineffective for the polymerization of epoxidized oils, a multi-component photo-initiating mixture was used.},

A highly porous biodegradable scaffold is essential to accommodate mammalian cells and guide their growth in three dimensions [2]. In the past, natural and synthetic polymers have routinely been used as substrates to provide this temporary scaffolding for transplanted cells as they excrete their extracellular matrix (ECM) and form new tissues or organs [1–4]. Although extensive research has been performed with both types of polymers, synthetic polymers offer several advantages over natural polymers such as collagen and fibrin. They can be prepared in a reproducible manner in almost unlimited quantities, and their physical, chemical, and mechanical properties may be easily altered by chemical modifications. In addition, they can be easily processed with conventional polymer processing equipment [5]. Some common synthetic biodegradable polymers currently used as scaffolding materials include polylactide (PLA), polyglycolide (PGA), and their copolymers, and polycaprolactone (PCL) [2–4]. Myriads of new materials including tyrosine-derived polycarbonates and trimethylene carbonate-based materials are also being explored as alternative synthetic polymers for tissue engineering scaffolds [5,6]. Many tissue engineering scaffold fabrication processes have been developed in order to meet the demands of tissue engineers. However, the majority of current scaffold fabrication techniques can be described as batch processes and/or use organic solvents, which can be detrimental to cell survival and tissue growth [7]. While these techniques may be adequate and essential for studying the effects of the substrate material, porosity, pore size, interconnectivity of the pores, mechanical and chemical properties, growth factors, and nutrient transport on the effects of tissue regeneration both in vitro and in vivo, they do not address the need for cost-effective manufacturing processes to meet patient needs. The ability to mass produce highly porous, highly interconnected scaffolds with complex geometries is essential to provide off-the-shelf availability [8]. Some of the most important and widely used fabrication methods using synthetic biodegradable polymers are explored here.},

abstract = {Cellulose-reinforced polycaprolactone (PCL) nanocomposite films were produced by casting from organic solvent. Microfibrillated cellulose derived from bleached pulp (MFC) and from pulp with high residual lignin content, termed microfibrillated lignocellulose (MFLC) were used as filler without any kind of chemical surface modification. Visual inspection revealed better dispersion of MFLC in organic solvent compared to MFC, resulting in a more homogeneous distribution of MFLC in PCL natrices compared to MFC. Tensile tests revealed an improvement of nanocomposite mechanical properties at 1{\%} and diminishing performance at higher filler content. Overall, the performance of MFLC filler resulted in more favorable nanocomposite tensile performance than MFC. This was particularly true when MFLC was not continuously processed in solvent, but converted to a powder by drying from non-polar solvent prior to compounding with the polymer solution. Thus a novel dry nanocellulosic filler option for hydrophobic polymers obtained in a simple process is presented.},

abstract = {The extensive production of conventional plastics and their use in different commercial applications poses a significant threat to both the fossil fuels sources and the environment. Alternatives called bioplastics evolved during development of renewable resources. Utilizing renewable resources like agricultural wastes (instead of petroleum sources) and their biodegradability in different environments enabled these polymers to be more easily acceptable than the conventional plastics. The biodegradability of bioplastics is highly affected by their physical and chemical structure. On the other hand, the environment in which they are located, plays a crucial role in their biodegradation. This review highlights the recent findings attributed to the biodegradation of bioplastics in various environments, environmental conditions, degree of biodegradation, including the identified bioplastic-degrading microorganisms from different microbial communities.},

abstract = {As an additive manufacturing technology, ultraviolet (UV)-curing three-dimensional printing, which requires the use of a photocurable resin, is increasingly being used to produce customized end-user parts of many complex shapes. In this study, to improve the strength and ductility of printing materials, nano-SiO2-reinforced photocurable resins were prepared by a planetary ball mill; then, the morphology, photochemistry, thermal property, and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were investigated and characterized. Transmission electron microscopy analysis indicated that the modified nano-SiO2 was well dispersed in the photocurable resin. The glass-transition temperature increased from 67.2°C for the unfilled resin to 71.7 and 80.1°C for nanocomposites with nano-SiO2 contents of 0.3 and 0.7 wt {\%}, respectively. The tensile strength and impact strength were increased by 46.7 and 165.3{\%} for nanocomposites with 0.3 wt {\%} nano-SiO2. The flexural modulus of the nanocomposites increased from 1.7 to 8.0 GPa when 0.7 wt {\%} nano-SiO2 was added to the photocurable resin; this appeared to originate from the relatively high level of dispersion and the intimate combination of the nano-SiO2 with the matrix. The investigation of the physical and chemical properties of such UV-curing materials showed that the low filler concentration ({\textless}1 wt {\%}) of nano-SiO2 did not affect the processability of the nanocomposites.},

They can be either natural or synthetic and can be derived from either renewable or nonrenewable resources. A series of truly biodegradable petroleum-based synthetic polymers have been developed. However, owing to concerns over environmental pollution and the depletion of fossil oils, intensive research is being conducted for developing biodegradable polymers and plastic materials from renewable natural resources such as starch, cellulose, and soy protein. Polylactic acid and polyhydroxyalkanoates are the two most important biodegradable polymers derived from renewable resources. They are thermoplastics and show mechanical properties and processability similar to some petroleum-based polymers. There have been many research achievements in biodegradable and biobased polymers, including naturally occurring biodegradable polymers, biodegradable polymers derived from renewable resources, and biodegradable polymers based on petroleum, although several biobased polymers may not be biodegradable.},

The specific tensile strength and modulus increased considerably after impregnation, especially at 80{\%} infill density. The morphology of printed composites indicated that good interfacial adhesion was obtained by impregnation of MA/CNC mixture and curing at elevated temperature. Thermal stability of the printed composites was also improved, as shown by increases in the temperature at maximum rate of weight loss and the glass transition temperature.

Hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged sulfate groups on the whisker surface and the ammonium groups of chitosan were the driving forces for the growth of the multilayered films. The film growth was followed by UV-vis spectroscopy through the maximum value of the absorption band at 194 nm and showed the deposition of 14.7 mg.m(-2) of chitosan polymer in each cycle. Scanning electron microscopy showed high density and homogeneous distribution of CNWs adsorbed on each chitosan layer. Cross-section characterization of the assembled films indicates an average of approximately 7 nm of thickness per bilayer.

abstract = {We report on the mechanical properties of optically curable stereolithographic resins (SLRs) which were reinforced through the addition of small amounts of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). The resin/filler mixtures are readily accessible via simple mixing processes. A detailed rheological investigation of such mixtures and the successful processing of these materials on a commercial SLR machine show that at low filler concentrations (below 5{\%}) the processability of the materials is barely impacted. The storage modulus, E′, increased steadily with increasing CNC content in the regimes below and above the glass transition. A remarkable modulus enhancement was observed in the rubbery regime, where E′ increased by 166, 233, and 587{\%} for CNC/SLR nanocomposites with 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0{\%} w/w CNC, respectively. The modulus increase was less pronounced in the glassy state, where E′ increased by 21, 32 and 57{\%}, for the same compositions. The increase in tensile strength was of similar magnitude. In comparison to previously reported CNC and carbon-nanofiller based nanocomposites, the presently investigated nanocomposites display a comparably large increase of stiffness and strength, which appear to originate from the high level of dispersion and the intimate contact of the CNCs with the SLR matrix. Through the fabrication of 3-dimensional parts, it was shown that the CNC-filled resins can be processed with standard equipment in a stereolithographic process that is widely used for rapid prototyping and rapid manufacturing. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The reversible kinetics of l-lactide bulk polymerization with tin(II) ethylhexanoate was determined over a wide range of temperatures, 130−220 °C, and monomer to initiator molar ratios, 1000−80 000. Both polymerization and depolymerization are accurately described by a reversible model with a propagation term that is first order in monomer and catalyst. The activation energy of propagation is 70.9 ± 1.5 kJ mol-1. The enthalpy, entropy, and ceiling temperature of polymerization are −23.3 ± 1.5 kJ mol-1, −22.0 ± 3.2 J mol-1 K-1, and 786 ± 87 °C, respectively. Crystallization increases the propagation rate and decreases the apparent monomer equilibrium in proportion to the degree of crystallinity. Natural hydroxyl impurities stoichiometrically control the polymer molecular weight but do not significantly affect the propagation rate.},

abstract = {Biomanufacturing of tissues/organs in vitro is our big dream, driven by two needs: organ transplantation and accurate tissue models. Over the last decades, 3D bioprinting has been widely applied in the construction of many tissues/organs such as skins, vessels, hearts, etc., which can not only lay a foundation for the grand goal of organ replacement, but also be served as in vitro models committed to pharmacokinetics, drug screening and so on. As organs are so complicated, many bioprinting methods are exploited to figure out the challenges of different applications. So the question is how to choose the suitable bioprinting method? Herein, we systematically review the evolution, process and classification of 3D bioprinting with an emphasis on the fundamental printing principles and commercialized bioprinters. We summarize and classify extrusion-based, droplet-based, and photocuring-based bioprinting methods and give some advices for applications. Among them, coaxial and multi-material bioprinting are highlighted and basic principles of designing bioinks are also discussed.},

abstract = {Fabrication of composite scaffolds using stereolithography (SLA) for bone tissue engineering has shown great promises. However, in order to trigger effective bone formation and implant integration, exogenous growth factors are commonly combined to scaffold materials. In this study, we fabricated biodegradable composite scaffolds using SLA and endowed them with osteopromotive properties in the absence of biologics. First we prepared photo-crosslinkable poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) resins containing 20 and 40 wt{\%} of hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles and fabricated scaffolds with controlled macro-architecture. Then, we conducted experiments to investigate how the incorporation of HA in photo-crosslinked PTMC matrices improved human bone marrow stem cells osteogenic differentiation in vitro and kinetic of bone healing in vivo. We observed that bone regeneration was significantly improved using composite scaffolds containing as low as 20 wt{\%} of HA, along with difference in terms of osteogenesis and degree of implant osseointegration. Further investigations revealed that SLA process was responsible for the formation of a rich microscale layer of HA corralling scaffolds. To summarize, this work is of substantial importance as it shows how the fabrication of hierarchical biomaterials via surface-enrichment of functional HA nanoparticles in composite polymer stereolithographic structures could impact in vitro and in vivo osteogenesis. Statement of Significance This study reports for the first time the enhance osteopromotion of composite biomaterials, with controlled macro-architecture and microscale distribution of hydroxyapatite particles, manufactured by stereolithography. In this process, the hydroxyapatite particles are not only embedded into an erodible polymer matrix, as reported so far in the literature, but concentrated at the surface of the structures. This leads to robust in vivo bone formation at low concentration of hydroxyapatite. The reported 3D self-corralling composite architecture provides significant opportunities to develop functional biomaterials for bone repair and tissue engineering.},

abstract = {A highly functional unsaturated ester macromonomer was synthesized from soybean oil (SBO), and its chemical structure was confirmed by FT-IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and gel permeation chromatography. The monomer was prepared through modifying epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) first with a synthesized precursor, hydroxyethyl acrylated maleate (HEAMA), and then employing maleic anhydride (MA) to modify the produced ESO-HEAMA. The obtained SBO-based monomer (ESO-HEAMA-MA) possessed a C=C bond functionality of 6.75-8.15 per ESO. Effects of styrene concentration, feed ratio, and initiator concentration on the dynamic mechanical properties of the cured bioresins were investigated carefully. When the monomer with the highest C=C bond functionality was used, the cured resins with 20-60 wt {\%} styrene demonstrated cross-link densities of 5.07-9.52 (103 mol)/m3, storage moduli at 25 °C of 1.32-2.16 GPa, glass transition temperatures of 69.9-114.1 °C, and tensile strengths and moduli of 19.7-33.1 MPa and 1.17-2.11 GPa, respectively. Microstructural morphologies of tensile-fractured surfaces of the cured resins were studied by scanning electron microscopy. Finally, curing behaviors of the resultant resin was studied by differential scanning calorimetry. The developed eco-friendly biomaterials have potential applications in the industry of unsaturated polyester resins.},

We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

Even though lignin, an abundant aromatic polymer from plants, is a natural UV screening agent, its unfavorable dark color hinders its high value-added applications in sunscreens and cosmetics. In this study, we separate lignin under mild conditions (at room temperature with neutral solvents) in order to prevent darkening occurring during delignification and apply the resultant lignin as a natural sunscreen ingredient for the first time. Lignins isolated from Miscanthus sacchariflorus (MWL-M) and from Pinus densiflora (MWL-P) are compared with organosolv lignin (OL), which showed the best sunscreen performance, in color and UV protection. MWLs separated under mild conditions were light in color unlike conventional lignins extracted under harsh conditions. UV absorption of light-colored MWL-M was revealed to be as high as dark-colored OL. MWLs also showed synergistic effects with a commercial sunscreen; exposure of the MWL-added sunscreen to UVA radiation greatly enhanced the sun protection factor (SPF) value of the sunscreen.},

Such new high-value materials are the subject of continuing research and are commercially interesting in terms of new products from the pulp and paper industry and the agricultural sector. Cellulose nanofibers can be extracted from various plant sources and, although the mechanical separation of plant fibers into smaller elementary constituents has typically required high energy input, chemical and/or enzymatic fiber pre-treatments have been developed to overcome this problem. A challenge associated with using nanocellulose in composites is the lack of compatibility with hydrophobic polymers and various chemical modification methods have been explored in order to address this hurdle. This review summarizes progress in nanocellulose preparation with a particular focus on microfibrillated cellulose and also discusses recent developments in bio-nanocomposite fabrication based on nanocellulose.},

abstract = {Current stereolithography (SL) technology can print there-dimensional (3D) objects with high precision and fast speed. However, for a complex computer-aided design (CAD) model, the fabricated structures have a significant amount of additional support structures that are required in order to ensure the model can be fabricated. However, these support structures may be difficult to remove. Even worse, the removal of the support structures may cause unexpected damage to delicate features and leave undesired surface marks. Although some special materials have been utilized in support structures such as water-soluble materials for the fused deposition modeling (FDM) process and wax for the multi-jet modeling (MJM) process, such support materials have not been available for the SL process. In this paper, a novel SL process using highly removable and widely available water as supports is presented. The process uses solid ice to surround the built parts in the layer-by-layer fabrication process. A cooling device is used to freeze the water into ice for each layer. The photocurable resin is spread on ice surface and then solidified by a projection image. Accordingly, a complex 3D object can be fabricated without using traditional support structures. After the fabrication process, the additional ice structure can easily be removed leaving no undesired marks on the bottom surfaces. Two test cases are presented to show the effectiveness of the presented highly removable water support method.},

abstract = {Reproduced from a chapter in: Kasapis, Modern Biopolymer Science (2009). From functioning as simple space-fillers, lubricants, or protective coatings, to providing three-dimensional matrices for cell growth, to acting as the functional moiety in environmentally responsive “smart devices,” the range of applications of biopolymers in biomedicine is vast. Hydrogel-forming biopolymer systems have characteristics that are advantageous in a biological context in comparison with more conventional engineering materials that have been used to repair damaged or missing tissues, the capacity to permit molecular diffusion due to high water content being a prime example. In mechanical terms, gel-forming biopolymers more closely resemble soft tissue and so increasingly find application in soft tissue repair, an area of biomaterials science that has received limited attention until relatively recently. In addition to the intrinsic physical properties, however, it is the fundamental chemistry of natural polymer systems that provides scope for some of the more ingenious applications of these materials to biomedical problems. For example, the capacity for certain biopolymers to form cross-linked gels under physiological conditions presents opportunities for minimally invasive routes to delivery of drug and or cell-loaded implants into the body. It is the purpose of this chapter to summarize some of the ways in which these materials are applied and to identify the contribution of the biopolymer in each example to the functionality of the system described.},

The proposed approach significantly promoted the catalyst surface area by restraining the anisotropic growth of the basal (0 0 1) plane of the M1-phase in calcination and decreased the diameter of M1 needles. Experimental results showed that phase-pure M1 catalyst treated with 1.0 mmol/L oxalic acid solution exhibited remarkably promoted catalyst performance of 73{\%} ethane conversion, 85{\%} ethylene selectivity and 0.77 k C2H4/kgcat/h catalyst productivity at 400 °C. The serial catalyst tests also demonstrated the structure sensitivity of M1 phase in the ODHE reaction. Active sites were located on the lateral faces as well as the basal plane of the M1 needles, but different effects on the catalyst selectivity were observed. The phase-pure M1 catalyst with a lower aspect ratio was suggested to provide better ethylene selectivity in ODHE process.},

abstract = {In view of the high incidence and long-term treatment of dental caries, personalized dental fillers with long therapeutic action have broad application prospects in the dental clinic. The objective of this study was to fabricate and evaluate novel dental fillers using state-of-the-art 3D printing technology. Tinidazole (TNZ), a commonly used antibacterial drug in the dental clinic, was chosen as the model compound. Models of molars with carious cavities were obtained via 3D scanning. TNZ dental fillers were indirectly produced by thermal pressing using customized 3D printed molds. In addition, bio-relevant in vitro dissolution and mechanical testing methods were developed using customized 3D printed release and compression molds, respectively. It was observed that the formability, mechanical properties, and release behavior of the TNZ dental fillers were affected by mold materials, plasticizers, and release modifiers. The developed dental fillers were capable of sustained releasing TNZ over one week. The TNZ release characteristics can be tailored based on clinical requirements by varying hydroxypropyl methylcellulose E5 (HPMC-E5) concentrations and filler dimensions. Moreover, computational simulation based on the finite element method showed that the biomechanical behavior of the TNZ dental fillers met the daily use requirement. The present study demonstrated that the state-of-the-art 3D printing technology can be used to design and fabricate personalized dental fillers with high mechanical strength and “on-demand” drug release characteristics.},

abstract = {A testing methodology was developed to expose photopolymer resins and measure the cured material to determine two key parameters related to the photopolymerization process: E c (critical energy to initiate polymerization) and D p (penetration depth of curing light). Five commercially available resins were evaluated under exposure from 365 nm and 405 nm light at varying power densities and energies. Three different methods for determining the thickness of the cured resin were evaluated. Caliper measurements, stylus profilometry, and confocal laser scanning microscopy showed similar results for hard materials while caliper measurement of a soft, elastomeric material proved inaccurate. Working curves for the five photopolymers showed unique behavior both within and among the resins as a function of curing light wavelength. E c and D p for the five resins showed variations as large as 10x. Variations of this magnitude, if unknown to the user and not controlled for, will clearly affect printed part quality. This points to the need for a standardized approach for determining and disseminating these, and perhaps, other key parameters.},

abstract = {Previous results concerning the modeling of scission of linear homopolymer chains are reviewed and new approaches are proposed, extending to length distributions for chains with different numbers of scission points and to copolymer chains. Analytical solutions for random and parabolic scission of a uniform population of polymer chains are compared and extended with solutions from a numerical scheme using Chebyshev polynomials (PREDICI{\textregistered}), giving rise to interesting conclusions concerning the relative lengths of the 3 different types of chains. The outcomes were applied to a reaction system with recombination of chain fragments, yielding an analytical solution of the 2-dimensional population balance problem in chain length and numbers of combination points. As regards copolymer scission an exact equation and a simple approximation for the fragment length distribution has been obtained based on all possible configurations of sequences of unbroken bonds between two types of monomer units. Scission of weaklinks could also be successfully treated using the simple approximation based on a copolymer composition weighted average scission probability. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Ganciclovir (GCV) is a nucleoside analogue with antiviral activity against herpes viral infections, and the most widely used antiviral to treat cytomegalovirus infections. However, the low bioavailability and short half-life of GCV necessitate the development of a carrier for sustained delivery. In this study, guanosine-based GCV was used as the initiator directly in ring-opening polymerization of $\epsilon$-caprolactone ($\epsilon$-CL) to form hydrophobic GCV-poly(caprolactone) (GCV-PCL) which was then grafted with hydrophilic chitosan to form amphiphilic copolymers for the preparation of stable micellar nanoparticles. Successful synthesis of GCV-PCL and GCV-PCL-chitosan were verified by 1H-NMR analysis. Self-assembled micellar nanoparticles were characterized by dynamic light scattering and zetasizer with an average size of 117 nm and a positive charge of 24.2 mV. The drug release kinetics of GCV was investigated and cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that GCV-tagged polymeric micelles were non-toxic. Our results showed that GCV could be used directly in the initiation of ring-opening polymerization of $\epsilon$-CL and non-toxic polymeric micelles for GCV delivery can be formed.},

@article{Dorgan2005,
abstract = {Polylactides (PLA) have been known for several decades and are recently of considerable commercial significance. However, the literature on basic chain properties and solution characterization is divided and inconsistent. In this study, a comprehensive and well-controlled set of experiments is combined with rigorous quantitative analysis to resolve existing apparent contradictions. Homopolymers and copolymers spanning wide ranges of molecular weight and stereoisomer proportions were prepared by ring-opening polymerizations of L- and D-lactides using stannous octanoate as the catalyst. Samples were characterized by means of: (1) dilute-solution viscometry in three different solvents; (2) size exclusion chromatography in tetrahydrofuran (THF) with light scattering detection; (3) static multiangle light scattering in a mixed acetonitrile–dichloromethane solvent; (4) variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry; and (5) melt rheology. The data imply that PLA are typical linear flexible polymers; unperturbed PLA chain dimensions are describable in terms of a characteristic ratio of 6.5 ± 0.9, regardless of stereoisomer content. The Schulz-Blaschke and Mark-Houwink constants for dilute PLA solutions in chloroform and in THF are determined. For chloroform at 30°C, the correct values are kSB = 0.302, K = 0.0131 (mL/g), and a = 0.759, while for THF at 30°C, the correct values are kSB = 0.289, K = 0.0174 (mL/g), and a = 0.736.},

abstract = {Analysis of cDNA clones that cross-hybridized with the fork head domain of the rat HNF-3 gene family revealed 10 cDNAs from human fetal brain and human testis cDNA libraries containing this highly conserved DNA-binding domain. Three of these cDNAs (HFK1, HFK2, and HFK3) were further analyzed. The cDNA HFK1 has a length of 2557 nucleotides and shows strong homology at the nucleotide level (91.2{\%}) to brain factor 1 (BF-1) from rat. The HFK1 cDNA codes for a putative 476 amino acid protein. The homology to BF-1 from rat in the coding region at the amino acid level is 87.5{\%}. The fork head homologous region includes 111 amino acids starting at amino acid 160 and has a 97.5{\%} homology to BF-1. Southern hybridization revealed that HFK1 is highly conserved among mammalian species and possibly birds. Northern analysis with total RNA from human tissues and poly(A)-rich RNA from mouse revealed a 3.2-kb transcript that is present in human and mouse fetal brain and in adult mouse brain. In situ hybridization with sections of mouse embryo and human fetal brain reveals that HFK1 expression is restricted to the neuronal cells in the telencephalon, with strong expression being observed in the developing dentate gyrus and hippocampus. HFK1 was chromosomally localized by in situ hybridization to 14q12. The cDNA clones HFK2 and HFK3 were analyzed by restriction analysis and sequencing. HFK2 and HFK3 were found to be closely related but different from HFK1. Therefore, it would appear that HFK1, HFK2, HFK3, and BF-1 form a new fork head related subfamily.},

NA (1.0 phr (per one hundred resin)) can exclusively nucleate the stereocomplex crystals, while Talc cannot suppress the homo crystallization of PLLA and PDLA in the stereo mixture. Double use of Talc and NA (in 1.0 phr each) is highly effective for enhancing the crystallization temperature of the stereo complex without forming the homo crystals. The stereocomplex crystals nucleated by NA show a significantly lower melting temperature (207??C) than the single crystal of the stereocomplex (230??C) in spite of recording a large heat of crystallization ??H c (54 J/g). Photomicrographic study suggests that the spherulites with a symmetric morphology are formed in the stereo mixture added with NA while the spherulites do not grow in size in the mixture added with Talc. The exclusive growth of the stereocomplex crystals by the melt-crystallization process will open a processing window for the PLLA/PDLA. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Preparation methods and fundamental characteristics of TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TOCN) are reviewed in this paper. Significant amounts of C6 carboxylate groups are selectively formed on each cellulose microfibril surface by TEMPO-mediated oxidation without any changes to the original crystallinity (∼74{\%}) or crystal width of wood celluloses. Electrostatic repulsion and/or osmotic effects working between anionically-charged cellulose microfibrils, the $\zeta$-potentials of which are approximately -75 mV in water, cause the formation of completely individualized TOCN dispersed in water by gentle mechanical disintegration treatment of TEMPO-oxidized wood cellulose fibers. Self-standing TOCN films are transparent and flexible, with high tensile strengths of 200-300 MPa and elastic moduli of 6-7 GPa. Moreover, TOCN-coated poly(lactic acid) films have extremely low oxygen permeability. The new cellulose-based nanofibers formed by size reduction process of native cellulose fibers by TEMPO-mediated oxidation have potential application as environmentally friendly and new bio-based nanomaterials in high-tech fields.},

Stereolithography for example can benefit from highly solid loaded, low viscosity and high transparency dispersions. This article presents the development of {\textgreater}40 vol.{\%}, UV curable transparent silica nanodispersions having viscosities suitable for stereolithography applications. The main parameters enabling these high loading dispersions are minimization of the Van der Waals attractive forces and affinity of monomer end group for the silica surface (e.g. hydrogen bonding). The minimization of the Van der Waals attraction is achieved by refractive index matching of the nanosilica and UV curable acrylate monomers. This results also in highly transparent dispersions having curing depths in the order of 10 mm in the UVA range. The transformation of selected dispersions to self-supporting silica glass sheets through UV curing, debinding and sintering was investigated by TGA/DTA, dilatometry and XRD. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The weak thermomechanical properties of commercial 3D printing plastics have limited the technology's application mainly to rapid prototyping. In this report, we demonstrate a simple approach that takes advantage of the metastable, temperature-dependent structure of graphene oxide (GO) to enhance the mechanical properties of conventional 3D-printed resins produced by stereolithography (SLA). A commercially available SLA resin was reinforced with minimal amounts of GO nanofillers and thermally annealed at 50 and 100 °C for 12 h. Tensile tests revealed increasing strength and modulus at an annealing temperature of 100 °C, with the highest tensile strength increase recorded at 673.6{\%} (for 1 wt {\%} GO). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) also showed increasing thermal stability with increasing annealing temperature. The drastic enhancement in mechanical properties, which is seen to this degree in 3D-printed samples reported in literature, is attributed to the metastable structure of GO, polymer-nanofiller cross-linking via acid-catalyzed esterification, and removal of intercalated water, thus improving filler-matrix interaction as evidenced by spectroscopy and microscopy analyses.},

abstract = {Copolymerization of mixtures of L-lactide and e-caprolactone has been initiated by diphenylzinc. The reaction conditions were investigated, to discover the effects on yield, molecular weight and microstructure of copolymers obtained. The temperature used varied between 50 and 120 degrees C, the molar ratio of monomer to initiator ranged between 90 and 1440 mol/mol, and the molar ratio of epsilon-caprolactone to L-lactide employed was between 100/0 and 0/100mol/mol. Copolymers were characterized by H-1-NMR, C-13-NMR, DSC and gel permeation chromatography. The results indicate that incorporation of L-lactide to the growing chain is preferred and epsilon-caprolactone is copolymerized after most of the L-lactide has been depleted. The microstructure of obtained copolyesters was affected considerably by transesterification reactions. It was observed that increasing reaction temperature, reaction time and concentration initiator was advantageous to the transesterification. The crystallinity of copolyester obtained was determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The results are in good agreement with both molar composition and sequence distribution of copolyesters.

abstract = {Objectives Additive manufacturing, which is more colloquially referred to as 3D printing, is quickly approaching mainstream adoption as a highly flexible processing technique that can be applied to plastic, metal, ceramic, concrete and other building materials. However, taking advantage of the tremendous versatility associated with in situ photopolymerization as well as the ability to select from a variety of preformed processible polymers, 3D printing predominantly targets the production of polymeric parts and models. The goal of this review is to connect the various additive manufacturing techniques with the monomeric and polymeric materials they use while highlighting emerging material-based developments. Methods Modern additive manufacturing technology was introduced approximately three decades ago but this review compiles recent peer-reviewed literature reports to demonstrate the evolution underway with respect to the various building techniques that differ significantly in approach as well as the new variations in polymer-based materials being employed. Results Recent growth of 3D printing has been dramatic and the ability of the various platform technologies to expand from rapid production prototypic models to the greater volume of readily customizable production of working parts is critical for continued high growth rates. This transition to working part production is highly dependent on adapting materials that deliver not only the requisite design accuracy but also the physical and mechanical properties necessary for the application. Significance With the weighty distinction of being called the next industrial revolution, 3D printing technologies is already altering many industrial and academic operations including changing models for future healthcare delivery in medicine and dentistry.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing technologies are nowadays employed in industry and prototype production in a range of different fields. A number of investigations have shown potential reductions of environmental impacts through the use of redesigned 3d printed products, although accurate information about the production phase is often missing. Despite the wide diffusion of stereolithography, reliable and updated data quantifying impacts of this technology are not available. In particular, this kind of information is lacking for desktop-scale stereolithography, whose market is increasing rapidly. This paper proposes a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment of bottom-up desktop stereolithography. The analysed system includes the phases of material production, transportation, transformation and post-processing. The functional unit of the assessment regards one printed part. To efficiently quantify the actual impacts, the study introduces as parameters the mass of the product to be manufactured, the mass of its supporting structures and the building time. This parametrisation allows for an easy integration of the proposed investigation for an extended cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment of the manufactured part. The life-cycle model was developed for a bottom-up desktop stereolithography apparatus located in Italy. Analyses and evaluations of the role of the different life-cycle phases in the environmental impact have been carried out in a specific case study.},

Based on a structured, systematic review and thematic content analysis of the discovered literature, we present a comprehensive classification of blockchain-enabled applications across diverse sectors such as supply chain, business, healthcare, IoT, privacy, and data management, and we establish key themes, trends and emerging areas for research. We also point to the shortcomings identified in the relevant literature, particularly limitations the blockchain technology presents and how these limitations spawn across different sectors and industries. Building on these findings, we identify various research gaps and future exploratory directions that are anticipated to be of significant value both for academics and practitioners.},

Two epoxidation processes were used: an in situ chemical epoxidation using hydrogen peroxide and formic acid, and a chemo-enzymatic epoxidation using 2 enzymes: Novozyme{\textregistered} 435 (CALB) and a homemade lipase/acyltransferase (CpLIP2). ESOs containing different numbers of epoxide groups/molecule were synthesized. A commercial ESO (Vikoflex{\textregistered} 7170) was employed and it had the highest number of epoxide groups. Acrylation of ESOs was carried out using acrylic acid, and copolymerized with a methyl methacrylate monomer. The chemo-enzymatic epoxidation produced high acid value, particularly from the CpLIP2 (!46-48{\%}) and indicated the formation of epoxidized free fatty acids. In contrast, the ESO synthesized from the chemical epoxidation showed a very low acid value, {\textless} 0.6{\%}. The AESOs synthesized from the CALB-based ESO and the chemical-based ESO showed a similar number of acrylate groups/molecule while that from the CpLIP2-based ESO showed a very low number of acrylate groups because the carboxylic groups from the epoxidized free fatty acids impeded the acrylation reaction. The lower the number of acrylate groups the lower was the crosslink density, the Tg, and the gel content in the AESO-co-PMMA copolymer. {\textcopyright} BME-PT.},

We report here on our study of these parameters and their influence the cDLP 3D printing process and the resulting mechanical properties. A series of PPF oligomers were synthesized by the ring-opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of maleic anhydride and propylene oxide followed by a base-catalyzed isomerization. The resin viscosities were measured as a function of number-average molecular mass (Mn) of the PPF oligomers (1.1, 1.7 and 2.0 kDa), concentrations of PPF in the reactive diluent diethyl fumarate (DEF) (50 and 75 wt {\%}) and resin temperature (25 to 55 °C). The zero-shear viscosity ($\eta$ 0 ) of the resins was found to be temperature-dependent and follow a linear Arrhenius relationship. Tensile tests demonstrated mechanical properties within the range of trabecular bone, with the ultimate strength at break above 15 MPa and elastic moduli between 178 and 199 MPa.},

abstract = {The osteochondral interface of an arthritic joint is notoriously difficult to regenerate due to its extremely poor regenerative capacity and complex stratified architecture. Native osteochondral tissue extracellular matrix is composed of numerous nanoscale organic and inorganic constituents. Although various tissue engineering strategies exist in addressing osteochondral defects, limitations persist with regards to tissue scaffolding which exhibit biomimetic cues at the nano to micro scale. In an effort to address this, the current work focused on 3D printing biomimetic nanocomposite scaffolds for improved osteochondral tissue regeneration. For this purpose, two biologically-inspired nanomaterials have been synthesized consisting of (1) osteoconductive nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (nHA) (primary inorganic component of bone) and (2) core-shell poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanospheres encapsulated with chondrogenic transforming growth-factor $\beta$1 (TGF-$\beta$1) for sustained delivery. Then, a novel table-top stereolithography 3D printer and the nano-ink (i.e., nHA + nanosphere + hydrogel) were employed to fabricate a porous and highly interconnected osteochondral scaffold with hierarchical nano-to-micro structure and spatiotemporal bioactive factor gradients. Our results showed that human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell adhesion, proliferation, and osteochondral differentiation were greatly improved in the biomimetic graded 3D printed osteochondral construct in vitro. The current work served to illustrate the efficacy of the nano-ink and current 3D printing technology for efficient fabrication of a novel nanocomposite hydrogel scaffold. In addition, tissue-specific growth factors illustrated a synergistic effect leading to increased cell adhesion and directed stem cell differentiation.},

abstract = {The hydrophilic features of natural fibers (NFs) hinder the widespread application of natural fiber/polymer composites due to the hydroxyl groups (-OH) presented in the cellulose molecule. Detecting reactive hydroxyl groups in NFs is very important for optimizing the modification process of natural fibers. This paper proposes a simple and practical methodology to measure reactive hydroxyl groups in NFs using a isocyanate group, a method we term the isocyanate group back titration (IBT) method. Application of the IBT method to ramie fiber with toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) and hexadecanol indicated that the measured value of reactive hydroxyl groups was about 150 mg KOH/g, which was less than the theoretical value of hydroxyl groups in the ramie fiber being tested. The FTIR analysis revealed that the TDI and hexadecanol were grafted onto the surface of the ramie fiber, leading the modified ramie fiber to be hydrophobic. Thus, the IBT method is also useful for modifying the surface properties of NFs and improving their compatibility with polymers, and finally leading to good mechanical properties of NF/polymer composites. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It examines whether Indonesian public sector reforms from the late 1990s to 2015, specifically the adoption of accrual accounting, are motivated by NPM philosophy. Reviewing and analysing Government regulations and reports, the study finds that the reforms are an attempt to implement NPM, specifically in relation to five financial management aspects (i.e. market-oriented, budgeting, performance management, financial reporting and auditing systems). However, the reforms are inconsistent with the NPM philosophy of efficiency and effectiveness in public service provisions. By requiring the use of the existing system, the reforms actually created inefficiency. This research is novel in investigating the gap between 'ideal concepts'and examining practices in an emerging country context.},

abstract = {Industry 4.0, referred to as the “Fourth Industrial Revolution”, also known as “smart manufacturing”, “industrial internet” or “integrated industry”, is currently a much-discussed topic that supposedly has the potential to affect entire industries by transforming the way goods are designed, manufactured, delivered and payed. This paper seeks to discuss the opportunities of Industry 4.0 in the context of logistics management, since implications are expected in this field. The authors pursue the goal of shedding light on the young and mostly undiscovered topic of Industry 4.0 in the context of logistics management, thus following a conceptual research approach. At first, a logistics-oriented Industry 4.0 application model as well as the core components of Industry 4.0 are presented. Different logistics scenarios illustrate potential implications in a practice-oriented manner and are discussed with industrial experts. The studies reveal opportunities in terms of decentralisation, self-regulation and efficiency. Moreover, it becomes apparent that the concept of Industry 4.0 still lacks a clear understanding and is not fully established in practice yet. The investigations demonstrate potential Industry 4.0 implications in the context of Just-in-Time/Just-in-Sequence and cross-company Kanban systems in a precise manner. Practitioners could use the described scenarios as a reference to foster their own Industry 4.0 initiatives, with respect to logistics management.},

abstract = {An environmentally friendly procedure in aq. soln. for the surface modification of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) using quaternary ammonium salts via adsorption was developed as inspired by organomodified layered silicates. CNCs with a high carboxylate content of 1.5 mmol g-1 were prepd. by a new route, direct hydrochloric acid hydrolysis of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical (TEMPO)-oxidized nanofibrillated cellulose from a softwood pulp, and characterized by at. force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Four quaternary ammonium cation surfactants bearing long alkyl, Ph, glycidyl, and diallyl groups were successfully used to modify CNCs carrying carboxylic acid groups as characterized by Fourier transform IR spectroscopy (FTIR). The modified CNCs can be redispersed and individualized in an org. solvent such as toluene as obsd. by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). One may envision removing excess surfactant to obtain CNC with a monolayer of surfactant. The toluene suspension of the modified CNCs showed strong birefringence under crossed polars but no further chiral-nematic ordering was obsd. The model surface prepd. by the CNCs modified with quaternary ammonium salts bearing C18 alkyl chains showed a significant increase in water contact angle (71°) compared to that of unmodified CNCs (12°). This new series of modified CNCs can be dried from solvent and have the potential to form well-dispersed nanocomposites with non-polar polymers. [on SciFinder(R)]},

abstract = {Nanocellulose, a unique and promising natural material extracted from native cellulose, has gained much attention for its use as biomedical material, because of its remarkable physical properties, special surface chemistry and excellent biological properties (biocompatibility, biodegradability and low toxicity). Three different types of nanocellulose, viz. cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) and bacterial cellulose (BC), are introduced and compared in terms of production, properties and biomedical applications in this article. The advancement of nanocellulose-based biomedical materials is summarized and discussed on the analysis of latest studies (especially reports from the past five years). Selected studies with significant findings are emphasized, and focused topics for nanocellulose in biomedicine research in this article include the discussion at the level of molecule (e.g. tissue bioscaffolds for cellular culture; drug excipient and drug delivery; and immobilization and recognition of enzyme/protein) as well as at the level of macroscopic biomaterials (e.g. blood vessel and soft tissue substitutes; skin and bone tissue repair materials; and antimicrobial materials). Functional modification of nanocellulose will determine the potential biomedical application for nanocellulose, which is also introduced as a separated section in the article. Finally, future perspectives and possible research points are proposed in Section 5.},

abstract = {This review covers fundamental kinetic features of living radical polymerization (LRP). Theories on polymerization rate Rp and polydispersity index (PDI) and experimental investigations into individual LRP systems are summarized. The presence of bimolecular termination, which is unavoidable in LRP as well as in conventional radical polymerization, provides LRP with the characteristic time dependence of radical concentrations and hence Rp and PDI, depending on experimental conditions, such as the presence or absence of conventional initiation. Despite the presence of termination (and initiation, in some cases), the product from LRP can have a low polydispersity, provided that the number of terminated chains is small compared to the number of potentially active, i.e. living, chains. On the premise that an activation–deactivation quasi-equilibrium holds, a large rate constant of activation, kact, is another fundamental requisite for low polydispersities. The kinetic parameters related to reversible activation reactions are tabulated. Treated in this review are nitroxide-mediated polymerization, atom transfer radical polymerization, iodide-mediated polymerization, reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer polymerization, and organotellurium-mediated radical polymerization.},

abstract = {The introduction of cerium oxide to phase-pure M1 MoVNbTeOx with CeO2 loading from 0 up to 90 wt.{\%} results in highly active catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE). These catalysts are characterized with BET, ICP, XRD, TEM, SEM and XPS techniques and tested for ODHE process. The results show that the increase of active site, V5+, is one of the dominant factors to improve the ethane conversion. In addition, the easier re-oxidation of V4+ to V5+ due to the presence of Ce4+ makes an extra contribution to the increase of turn-over frequency. Among all the catalysts, M1 catalyst with 30 wt.{\%} CeO2 loading obtains the best productivity of 0.69 kgC2H4/kgcat{\textperiodcentered}h while the corresponding performance of phase-pure M1 catalyst is 0.34 kgC2H4/kgcat{\textperiodcentered}h at 400 °C with the contact time of 18.52 gcat{\textperiodcentered}h/molC2H6. It is further demonstrated that M1/CeO2 catalyst (e.g., with 50 wt.{\%} CeO2 as a representative) loading remains highly active after 3 cycles of refreshment in situ, and its crystal structure and surface morphology keep stable compared to the fresh catalyst.},

While currently used primarily to manufacture prototypes and mockups, a number of promising applications exist in the production of replacement parts, dental crowns, and artificial limbs, as well as in bridge manufacturing. 3-D printing has been compared to such disruptive technologies as digital books and music downloads that enable consumers to order their selections online, allow firms to profitably serve small market segments, and enable companies to operate with little or no unsold finished goods inventory. Some experts have also argued that 3-D printing will significantly reduce the advantages of producing small lot sizes in low-wage countries via reduced need for factory workers. {\textcopyright} 2011 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.},

abstract = {In this review, homogeneous and heterogeneous grafting from cellulose and cellulose derivatives by ring-opening polymerisation (ROP) are reported. Cellulose is biorenewable and biodegradable as well as a stiff material with a relatively low specific weight, foreseen to be an excellent replacement for synthetic materials. By utilising ROP of monomers such as -caprolactone or l-lactide from cellulose, composite materials with new and/or improved properties can be obtained. Grafting of solid cellulose substrates, such as cotton, microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) or cellulose nanocrystals, renders cellulose that can easily be dispersed into polymer matrices and may be used as reinforcing elements to improve mechanical and/or barrier properties of biocomposites. A surface grafted polymer can also tailor the interfacial properties between a matrix and the fibrillar structure of cellulose. When derivatives of cellulose are grafted with polymers in homogenous media, amphiphilic materials with interesting properties can be achieved, anticipated to be utilised for applications such as encapsulation and release. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This review article summarises the sources, occurrence, fate and effects of plastic waste in the marine environment. Due to its resistance to degradation, most plastic debris will persist in the environment for centuries and may be transported far from its source, including great distances out to sea. Land- and ocean-based sources are the major sources of plastic entering the environment, with domestic, industrial and fishing activities being the most important contributors. Ocean gyres are particular hotspots of plastic waste accumulation. Both macroplastics and microplastics pose a risk to organisms in the natural environment, for example, through ingestion or entanglement in the plastic. Many studies have investigated the potential uptake of hydrophobic contaminants, which can then bioaccumulate in the food chain, from plastic waste by organisms. To address the issue of plastic pollution in the marine environment, governments should first play an active role in addressing the issue of plastic waste by introducing legislation to control the sources of plastic debris and the use of plastic additives. In addition, plastics industries should take responsibility for the end-of-life of their products by introducing plastic recycling or upgrading programmes.},

A combination of sonication, and mechanical and magnetic stirring was used to disperse 0.25. wt{\%} and 0.75. wt{\%} of MWCNTs into the resin. Two photocuring cycles using 12 and 24. h UV-A radiation were studied. Nanoindentation was the chosen technique for characterizing the modulus of elasticity and hardness of samples. The curing degree and glass transition temperature of the epoxyacrylate matrix and the nanocomposites were determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). In addition, the Vickers microhardness and nanocomposite morphology were also investigated by Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electronic Microscopy (TEM). The results indicate an increase in the stiffness and hardness of the material, and a shift in the glass transition temperature. The increase in the elastic modulus is in concordance with the predictions made by two simple models: rule of mixture and Halpin-Tsai equation. A fair agreement between nanoindentation and microhardness measurements is also found. Finally, the importance of curing degree in some of the properties investigated in this study is also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The effect of chemical structures of the epoxy thermosets on their crosslink density, swelling property, crystallization behavior, dynamic and static mechanical properties, as well as thermal stability was studied systematically. The crosslink density of the epoxy thermosets increased obviously, the gel fraction almost kept unchanged, and the swelling ratio decreased gradually with increasing R-value. The crystallization capability and degree of crystallinity were enhanced meanwhile melting temperature shifted to higher temperature range with increasing R-value, due to the increased concentration of polyamide 1010 segments in the thermoset. Consequently, the stiffness and heat resistance of the epoxy thermosets were enhanced. The Young's modulus increased gradually and the break stress as well as the break strain first increased and then decreased with increasing R-value. This investigation provides a new strategy to regulate physical properties of soybean oil-based epoxy thermosets, which would be valuable for other plant oil-based polymers design.},

abstract = {Polymer nanocomposites have always attracted the interest of researchers and industry because of their potential combination of properties from both the nanofillers and the hosting matrix. Gathering nanomaterials and 3D printing could offer clear advantages and numerous new opportunities in several application fields. Embedding nanofillers in a polymeric matrix could improve the final material properties but usually the printing process gets more difficult. Considering this drawback, in this paper we propose a method to obtain polymer nanocomposites by in situ generation of nanoparticles after the printing process. 3D structures were fabricated through a Digital Light Processing (DLP) system by disolving metal salts in the starting liquid formulation. The 3D fabrication is followed by a thermal treatment in order to induce in situ generation of metal nanoparticles (NPs) in the polymer matrix. Comprehensive studies were systematically performed on the thermo-mechanical characteristics, morphology and electrical properties of the 3D printed nanocomposites.},

abstract = {The so-called M1 phase (the common formula (TeO)x(Mo, V, Nb)5O14) is a very promising catalyst for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODE). It shows 90{\%} selectivity to ethylene at 78{\%} ethane conversion (400 °C, contact time-5.5 s). The active crystal structure is formed under certain synthetic conditions in VMoNbTe mixed oxides. This paper is devoted to the analysis of how the local and average structure of the M1 phase is developed during the synthesis and what happens at particular synthetic steps. The analysis of the local structure was performed using the EXAFS and pair distribution function (PDF) methods. The EXAFS analysis of the initial VMoTe water solution and VMoNbTe slurry showed that Anderson-type heteropoly anions are formed in the solution and are preserved after fast spray-drying of the slurry. Nb cations do not enter the structure of the polyanions, but form an extended hydrated oxide matrix, where distorted NbO6 and NbO7 polyhedrons are connected to each other. The hydrated oxide matrix with captured polyanions provides the compositional homogeneity of the precursor. The distances in the second coordination shell are redistributed after thermal treatment at 310 °C. After being heated at T {\textgreater} 350°, the local structure of the M1 phase is organized and pentagonal domains are formed. These domains consist of a NbO7 pentagonal bipyramid and five MeO6 adjacent octahedra (Me = Mo, V). In the first stages, the building blocks are stacked along the [001] direction. The crystallization process results in the connection of the pentagonal domains to the extended polygonal grid. The formation of the regular grid with TeOx containing channels is accompanied by the increase in ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity of the catalysts.},

The stiffness of the cellulose hydrogel was found to be independent on the crystallinity of a skeletal gel matrix, suggesting that the poroelasticity made a significant contribution to mechanical properties of the hydrogel. Indeed, typical poroelastic responses were observed when the cellulose hydrogels were subjected to the compression tests with varied compression strain rates (i.e. softness upon slow compression but stiffness upon fast compression). The fluid mechanics theory showed that sub-micrometer-scale morphological difference of the gel matrix, which was observable by scanning electron microscopy, affected the flow behavior of water inside porous structure, leading to the increased stiffness upon fast compression.},

Monomer-to-catalyst and cocatalyst-to-catalyst molar ratios were changed from 500 to 4000 and from 1 to 600, respectively. In agreement with previous literature, the catalyst concentration is affecting the reaction rate, whereas OH-bearing species (such as cocatalyst and impurities) are controlling both reaction rate and polymer molecular weight. A model implementing a living kinetic scheme is first developed and validated by comparison with the experimental results. The rate coefficients of the main reactions (activation, propagation, and reversible chain transfer) have been evaluated. Finally, to predict with accuracy the broadening of the molecular weight distribution, we introduce ester interchange reactions, so-called “transesterifications”, into the kinetic scheme, and the corresponding rate coefficient is evaluated.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses Blockchain distributed ledgers in the context of public and private Blockchains, enterprise Blockchain deployments, and the role of Blockchains in next-generation artificial intelligence systems, notably deep learning Blockchains. Blockchain technology is a software protocol for the secure transfer of unique instances of value (e.g., money, property, contracts, and identity credentials) via the Internet without requiring a third-party intermediary such as a bank or government. Public Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are trustless (human counterparties and intermediaries do not need to be trusted, just the software) and permissionless (open use), whereas private Blockchains are trusted and permissioned. Enterprise Blockchains are private (trusted, not trustless) immutable decentralized ledgers, with varying methods of reaching consensus (validating and recording transactions). Four enterprise systems are examined: R3's Corda, Ethereum Quorum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Ripple. New business analytics and data science methods are needed such as next-generation artificial intelligence solutions in the form of deep learning algorithms together with Blockchains. The hidden benefit of Blockchain for data analytics is its role in creating “clean data”: validated, trustable, interoperable, and standardized data. Business Blockchains may develop across industry supply chains with shared business logic and processes, and shared financial ledgers. Payment channels and smart contract asset pledging may allow net settlement across supply chains and reduce debt and working capital obligations. Specific use cases are considered in global automotive supply chains, healthcare, digital identity credentialing, higher education, digital collectibles (CryptoKitties), and asset tokens (Primalbase).},

The sintered bodies displayed significant shrinkage after sintering, with the maximum shrinkage being 35.26{\%}. The XRD pattern indicated that the crystalline phase of the parts was the t-ZrO2 phase, while SEM characterization revealed that the sintered bodies were composed of densely packed submicron-grade grains, without any discernible pores. The density of the parts was measured as 97.14{\%} via Archimedes' water displacement method, which is consistent with the results of SEM characterization. Additionally, the measured Vickers hardness and fracture toughness of the fabricated parts were 13.0597 GPa and 6.0380 MPa m1/2, respectively. These values are close to the structural properties of common zirconia ceramics prepared by conventional approaches. Hence, a novel DLP-stereolithography-based 3D printing process for the fabrication of complex and dense zirconia ceramic parts has been proposed in this work.},

The uniqueness of these materials compared to their petroleum-derived equivalents is that in addition to being inexpensive they are also biocompatible and in some cases biodegradable. Most of them can also be made from byproducts of the biodiesel process, which is a most fortuitous dual utilization of the new biodiesel plants springing up around the world. The linear polymers with molecular weights of the order of 106 Da of plant derived high-oleic oils are made by emulsion polymerization using water as a solvent. The resulting water-borne latex particles are placed on a substrate—such as paper or polymer—and as the water evaporates, they coalesce by interdiffusion to form thin films. The resulting PSA products are the familiar Scotch tapes, postage stamps, name labels, duct tape, masking tapes, and packaging labels. The chapter also compares the mechanical properties of a renewable resource-based dispersion with those of two petroleum-based dispersions.},

The characterization of the coating obtained by different techniques showed that a one layer coating contained almost no active M1 phase and mainly M2 phase whereas a two layers coating presented a significant amount of M1 phase. The structured catalyst thus obtained with two layers appeared highly efficient and stable in both reactions between 380 and 420 °C and the oxide coating exhibited fairly good mechanical properties. When compared to the most efficient powdered pure M1 phase in the case of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and M1 + M2 phase mixture in the case of propane ammoxidation, the coated foam appeared less active; the reduced activity was attributed to the lower content in M1 phase of the supported catalyst. The selectivity to ethylene was lower, that to acrylonitrile was comparable; the decrease in ethylene selectivity was due to the presence of other active but not selective phases like TeMo 5O 15 and Mo 0.97V 0.95O 5. In the case of acrylonitrile the synergy effect that takes place between the M1 and M2 phases also took place between the Mo 0.97V 0.95O 5 phase and the M2 phase and maintained the selectivity to acrylonitrile. Improvements in preparation conditions are still possible to open the door to intensification and miniaturization on the process of propane ammoxidation on these efficient coated SiC foam structured reactors. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Polylactic Acid (PLA) is the first viable thermoplastic that can be produced from a plant-based feedstock such as corn or sugar cane, and yet be processed by the conventional melt processing technologies. At the same time, Polylactic Acid is produced at the largest industrial scale of all biodegradable polymers. It is being used in biomedical applications, for bottle production and in compostable food packaging. It is also being evaluated as a material for tissue engineering. Mass production has tremendously reduced the cost of PLA production, making it an economically viable choice for fabrication of domestic containers, plastic bags, and fibers. Commercial-scale plants today produce hundreds of thousand tons of PLA per year. This book provides a practical guide for the engineers and scientists involved in working with PLA and developing the many new products that are emerging for this important biopolymer. The current market situation for PLA and biodegradable polymers is described as well as applications across a range of market sectors, and the mechanical, chemical, thermal, rheology, and degradation properties of PLA. •An essential reference for engineers, scientists and product designers considering switching to a sustainable plastic. •Covers the properties, synthesis and polymerization of PLA, and processing techniques involved in fabricating parts from this polymer.},

abstract = {From macro- to nano-engineering of a promising CeO2-ZrO2-doped NiO-Al2O3/Ni-foam catalyst has been demonstrated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene (ODE), through facial wet chemical etching of a Ni-foam followed post modification with CeO2 and ZrO2. The NiO-Al2O3/Ni-foam (denoted as NANF) achieved a high ethane conversion of 25.2{\%} but with a very low ethylene selectivity of 43.1{\%} at 450 °C. ZrO2-doping of the NANF led to a remarkable improvement in the ethylene selectivity but serious deterioration of activity while the CeO2-doping showed an opposite effect. Co-doping of the NANF using optimal amount of CeO2 and ZrO2 markedly promoted not only the activity but also the selectivity to ethylene. For example, over the 1CeO2-5ZrO2-NANF (CeO2:1 wt{\%}, ZrO2:5 wt{\%}) catalyst, a high ethane conversion of 40.3{\%} was obtained with a 60.6{\%} ethylene selectivity for a feed gas of C2H6/O2/N2 = 1/1/8 at 500 °C and a gas hourly space velocity of 18,000 cm3 g−1 h−1, corresponding to a high ethylene productivity of 510 gEthylene kgcat−1 h−1. In nature, co-doping with CeO2 and ZrO2 synergistically tamed the NiO for selective H-abstraction of the ethane molecules other than over oxidation of them.},

A large number of interesting applications are emerging for these materials. In Europe, the emphasis is on the automotive industry which is looking into the use of plant fiber-based composites as a way to serve the environment and at the same time save weight (and therefore fuel). In North America, wood fiber-based composite building materials have been developing for some time. In India and South America, jute and sugar cane fibers are used in low cost housing. Wherever the industry, there will be a locally grown lignocellulosic fiber to suit the application. In addition, natural fiber present a multi-level organization and consist of several cells formed out of semi-crystalline oriented cellulose microfibrils that open opportunities in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Polypropylene (PP)/microcrystalline cellulose (MCC)/wood flour composites were prepared containing polypropylene-graft-maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA) as compatibilizer. The mechanical, morphological and thermal properties were investigated. The weight ratio of the cellulosic materials to polymer matrix was 40:60 (w:w). The obtained results showed that tensile, flexural and impact strengths of the composites were significantly enhanced with addition of MCC, as compared with pure PP and composites without MCC. The effect of MCC on impact was minimal compared to the effects of PP-g-MA content. Scanning electron microscopy has shown that the composite, with compatibilizer, promotes better fiber-matrix interaction. In all cases, the degradation temperatures shifted to higher values after addition of PP-g-MA. The maximum improvement on the thermal stability of the composites was achieved when 5{\%} PP-g-MA was used. However, the increase in MCC content substantially reduced the thermal stability. This work showed that MCC along with wood flour could be effectively used as reinforcing agent in thermoplastic matrix. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

After reducing the relaxation time data to a single mastercurve, a 4-parameter function is fitted to the data to allow prediction of the change in relaxation time following an arbitrary thermal history. The method enables separation of the effects of temperature and of degradation on the relaxation time, both of which lead to a horizontal shift of dynamic data along the frequency axis, and hence enable a correction for thermal degradation during rheometry to be carried out. To validate the method, two isothermal frequency sweeps were measured with different temperature histories, producing different mastercurves due to dissimilar in-test thermal degradation. After correcting for thermal degradation using the function and the thermal histories, the two frequency sweeps reduce to the same viscoelastic mastercurve in the undegraded pre-test state.},

This critical review summarises the different conditions which have been described to synthesise PCL, and gives a broad overview of the different catalytic systems that were used (enzymatic, organic and metal catalyst systems). A surprising variety of catalytic systems have been studied, touching on virtually every section of the periodic table. A detailed list of reaction conditions and catalysts/initiators is given and reaction mechanisms are presented where known. Emphasis is put on the ROP pathway due to its prevalence in the literature and the superior polymer that is obtained. In addition, ineffective systems that have been tried to catalyse the production of PCL are included in the electronic supplementary information for completeness (141 references).},

abstract = {The incorporation of hydrodynamics in an industrial wall-cooled packed bed reactor model is essential to describe the performance of highly exothermic oxidation reactions. Although the conventional hydrodynamic approach (CHA), Navier-Stokes equations coupled to Darcy-Forchheimer terms, has been the most used approximation to describe velocity profiles in these packed bed reactors, it is itself inconsistent and the computation time for its numerical solution, when coupled to the reactor model, is still demanding. This work is aimed at developing a practical but reliable hydrodynamic approach (PHA) to describe velocity profiles in packed bed reactors presenting a low tube to particle diameter ratio. In this approach, velocity profiles are described at the core and close to the wall of the reactor. The core model makes use of the Darcy-Forchheimer equation (DFE), and the wall model makes use of Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) using an effective viscosity to account for turbulence. The PHA predicts similar results to those obtained by the CHA and properly fits velocity observations from packed beds with a tube to particle diameter ratio (dt/dp) ranging from 3 to 6. The PHA allows the estimation of both turbulent viscosity ($\mu$t) involved in the viscous term of the NSE and parameters influencing viscous ($\alpha$) and inertial ($\beta$) flow resistances in Darcy and Forchheimer terms, respectively. Then, hydrodynamics is coupled to a heat transport model accounting for conductive anisotropy to fit temperature observations in absence of reaction from a pilot-scale packed bed reactor with a dt/dp = 3.048. Hydrodynamics and heat transfer results are, then, transferred to a pseudo heterogeneous reactor model to simulate the behavior of a novel technology to perform the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on a multimetallic MoVNbTeO formulation. This is the first study modeling this reactor system accounting for hydrodynamics, information that is essential for its conceptual design in future studies. Finally, it is worth stressing that the PHA, coupled to the heat transport model or the reactor model, leads to significantly lower computation times than the CHA, which is attributed to the analytical rather than numerical solution of the former.},

abstract = {The increasing demand for light olefins and the changing nature of basic feedstock has stimulated substantial research activity into the development of new process routes. Steam cracking remains the most industrially relevant pathway, but other routes for light-olefin production have emerged. Fluid catalytic cracking only produces ethene in minor concentrations. Challenged by marked catalyst deactivation, in contrast, catalytic dehydrogenation ethane up opens a more selective route to ethene. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane, which couples the endothermic dehydration of ethane with the strongly exothermic oxidation of hydrogen, would potentially be the most attractive alternative route because it avoids the need for excessive internal heat input, but also consumes valuable hydrogen. In this Review, the current state of the ODH of ethane is compared with other routes for light-olefin production, with a focus on the catalyst and reactor system variants. New catalyst systems and reactor designs have been developed to improve the industrial competitiveness of the ODH reaction of ethane. The current state of our fundamental understanding of the ODH of light alkanes, in particular in terms of catalyst and reactor development, is critically reviewed. The proposed mechanisms and the nature of the active site for the ODH reaction are described and discussed in detail for selected promising catalysts. The reported catalytic performance and the possible limitations of these ODH catalysts will be examined and the performance of the emerging approaches is compared to the currently practiced methods. A great suC Cess: The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane is a process that enables the production of ethene with high selectivities. Different catalysts and reactor configurations have been developed for this process. This Review focuses on the mechanistic aspects of heterogeneously catalyzed ODH reactions and the main features and common principles of this reaction are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

Effects of microwave radiation doses and different reaction parameters were optimized to get the optimum percentage of grafting. The dependence of optimum conditions for better physico-chemical properties of the cellulosic polymers was also determined. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis was used to authenticate the chemical reaction taking place between cellulosic polymers and monomer. The thermogravimetric behavior of the raw and grafted cellulosic polymers was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The surface structure of the raw and grafted cellulosic polymers was analyzed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

In this paper, consideration is given to the role of one such advanced manufacturing process technology: additive manufacturing. The consequences of adopting this novel production technology on industrial sustainability are not well understood and this exploratory study draws on publically available data to provide insights into the impacts of additive manufacturing on sustainability. Benefits are found to exist across the product and material life cycles through product and process redesign, improvements to material input processing, make-to-order component and product manufacturing, and closing the loop. As an immature technology, there are substantial challenges to these benefits being realised at each stage of the life cycle. This paper summarises these advantages and challenges, and discusses the implications of additive manufacturing on sustainability in terms of the sources of innovation, business models, and the configuration of value chains.},

We demonstrate the rapid prototyping of sustainable resins using a stereolithographic 3D printer. Resin formulation takes place by straightforward mixing of biobased acrylate monomers and oligomers with a photoinitiatior and optical absorber. Resin viscosity is controlled by the monomer to oligomer ratio and is determined as a function of shear rate by a rheometer with parallel plate geometry. A stereolithographic apparatus charged with the biobased resins is employed to produce complex shaped prototypes with high accuracy. The products require a post-treatment, including alcohol rinsing and UV irradiation, to ensure complete curing. The high feature resolution and excellent surface finishing of the prototypes is revealed by scanning electron microscopy.},

As an advanced technology, 3D printing has been used to fabricate complex and high-precision objects in many fields. 3D printing has several technologies. Among these technologies, photo-curing 3D printing was the earliest and most mature technology. In 1988, the first 3D printing machine which was based on photo-curing and called Stereo lithography Appearance (SLA) technology was produced by 3D system Corp. After 30 years of development, many new technologies based on photocuring mechanism emerged. Based on the different principle of pattern formation and character of printing technology, numerous photocuring 3D printing techniques, such as SLA, DLP, LCD, CLIP, MJP, two-photon 3D printing, holographic 3D printing and so on, have been developed. Photo-curing 3D printing has many advantages, such as high precision, smooth surface of printing objects, rapid printing speed and so on. Here, we would introduce five industrial photocuring 3D printing technologies, which are SLA, DLP, LCD, CLIP and MJP. The characters of the materials and the progress of the application of the technique in the biomedical field is also overviewed. At last, the difficulties and challenges of photo-curing 3D printing are also discussed.},

CNCs were obtained by acid hydrolysis of bleached bagasse pulp and functionalized with adipic acid. The results showed that unmodified CNCs exhibit both a high crystallinity index and a significant aspect ratio. Surface modification with adipic acid decreases the nanocrystal dimensions due to removal of the amorphous region between the crystalline domains and also changes the electrostatic repulsion and hydrophilic affinity of CNCs. Unmodified CNCs offer potential applications as reinforcing phase in hydrophilic polymeric matrices, while modified CNCs interact better with hydrophobic matrices. The use of CNCs as reinforcement in polymer nanocomposites expands the application of this renewable material and increases its added value, providing nonenergy-based markets for the main biomass of the sugarcane industry.},

Firstly, CNF was isolated by enzymatic hydrolysis combined with high-pressure homogenization. CNF/PLA filaments were then prepared by melt-extrusion of PLA as the matrix and CNF as the filler. Thermal stability, mechanical performance, and water absorption property of biocomposite filaments and 3D-printed objects were analyzed. Findings showed that CNF increased the thermal stability of the PLA/PEG600/CNF composite. Compared to unfilled PLA FDM filaments, the CNF filled PLA biocomposite filament showed an increase of 33{\%} in tensile strength and 19{\%} in elongation at break, suggesting better compatibility for desktop FDM 3DP. This study provided a new potential for the high-value utilization of CNF in 3DP in consumer product applications.},

A propagation rate constant of 1.65 L‚mol -1 ‚s -1 was determined in dichloromethane. The reaction proceeds via a three-step mechanism. In the first step the large 2,6-di-tert-butylphenoxy ligands are exchanged for the smaller 2-propanol. In the second step the polar alkoxide is able to attack the carbonyl group and form the thermodynamically favored ring-opened product. After the first two initiating steps, the polymerization can proceed until complete conversion of monomer is reached. Evidence for these three steps is provided by 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy of the reaction products of each single step. The kinetic behavior of commercially available yttrium isopropoxide was more complicated. 2-Propanol could be used as an effective chain transfer agent for this initiator.},

It has to be integrated with other Business Process Management system (BPM) components to implement specified functionalities related to the applications. The current efforts in integrating this technology into BPM are at a very early stage. To apply Blockchain into business processes efficiently, Blockchain and business process characteristics must be identified. Inconsistency of confirmation settlement that heavily relies on the implementation of consensus protocol poses a major challenge in business process operations, especially ones that are time-critical. In addition, validators, nodes responsible for performing consensus operations in a Blockchain system, can introduce bias and as a result are not trustable. This paper first defines Blockchain and also investigates the characteristics of Blockchain and business processes. Then, we suggest an architecture of business processes in Blockchain era to overcome the problems of time inconsistency and consensus bias. The architecture provides persistency, validity, auditability, and disintermediary that Blockchain offers. The architecture also provides flexibility by allowing business partner to select nodes in performing consensus; thus bias is mitigated.},

abstract = {Protein solubility is affected by ions. At low ion concentrations ({\textless}0.5 M), protein solubility increases along with ionic strength. Ions in the solution shield protein molecules from the charge of other protein molecules in what is known as 'salting-in' (Fig. 7.1). At a very high ionic strength, protein solubility decreases as ionic strength increases in the process known as 'salting-out'. Thus, salting out can be used to separate proteins based on their solubility in the presence of a high concentration of salt. In this protocol, ammonium sulfate will be added incrementally to an E. coli cell lysate to isolate a recombinantly over-expressed protein of 20 kDa containing no cysteine residues or tags. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {To better understand pyrolysis mechanism and further develop selective pyrolysis technology, characteristics of volatile products in the pyrolysis of three main components (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) were investigated and compared by amplifying experiments in a tube furnace at 300–700 °C. Distribution of volatile products (including bio-oil and bio-gas), the influence of temperature and contributions of each single component were discussed in depth. It was found that, for each sample pyrolysis, pyrolysis temperature and their own chemical structures played an important role in the yields, composition of bio-oil and bio-gas. The optimal temperatures for production of bio-oil from cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin focused at 500 °C, 450 °C and 600 °C, respectively, and cellulose made greater contribution to bio-oil formation, and hemiellulose was the major contributor for bio-gas. Moreover, the more bio-gases from the three components generated at the higher temperature, but compositions of volatile products were different depending on their unique chemical structures. In the three components, cellulose produced the highest CO, hemicellulose owned the highest CO2, and lignin generated the highest CH4 characterized by the largest HHV. As for bio-oil, cellulose bio-oil displayed unique saccharides and higher furans, hemicellulose bio-oil contained higher acids and ketones, while phenols were the dominant composition of lignin bio-oil.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 SECV A stereolithography-based additive manufacturing technique has been used for the fabrication of advanced ceramics. A customised 3D printer using a Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector as UV source has been built to fabricate green bodies from photosensitive resins loaded with 25–60 wt{\%} of alumina, 3- and 8-YSZ. The 3D-printed bodies were then sintered in the 1200–1500 °C and exhibited thermal stability. As expected, higher ceramic loadings rendered objects with higher density for a given sintering temperature. The limit of solid loading in the resin is approximately 60{\%} and beyond those contents, the extra ceramic appears as powder loosely adhered to the sintered objects. Photogrammetry was used to evaluate the accuracy of the 3D printing process and highlighted a marked deviation between the CAD model and the resulting object, particularly in the top part of the specimens, possibly due to the use of volatile solvents which cause changes in the photoresins used. Nevertheless, that problem may be overcome by thermostatising the printer vat and/or using solvents with higher boiling point. The results obtained suggest the potential application of low cost DLP 3D printing techniques to process ceramics for a number of applications including ceramic fuel cells, piezoelectrics, dental applications, etc.},

abstract = {Microfluidics imposes different requirements on 3D printing compared to many applications because the critical features for microfluidics consist of internal microvoids. Resins for general 3D printing applications, however, are not necessarily formulated to meet the requirements of microfluidics and minimize the size of fabricated voids. In this paper we use an optical approach to guide custom formulation of resins to minimize the cross sectional size of fabricated flow channels as exemplars of such voids. We focus on stereolithography (SL) 3D printing with Digital Light Processing (DLP) based on a micromirror array and use a commercially available 3D printer. We develop a mathematical model for the optical dose delivered through the thickness of a 3D printed part, including the effect of voids. We find that there is a fundamental trade-off between the homogeneity of the optical dose within individual layers and how far the critical dose penetrates into a flow channel during fabrication. We also experimentally investigate the practical limits of flow channel miniaturization given the optical properties of a resin and find that the minimum flow channel height is ∼3.5-5.5 ha where ha is the optical penetration depth of the resin, and that the minimum width is 4 pixels in the build plane. We also show that the ratio of the build layer thickness to ha should be in the range 0.3-1.0 to obtain the minimum flow channel height for a given resin. The minimum flow channel size that we demonstrate for a custom resin is 60 $\mu$m × 108 $\mu$m for a 10 $\mu$m build layer thickness. This work lays the foundation for 3D printing of {\textless}100 $\mu$m microfluidic features.},

Derived from the must abundant and renewable biopolymer, they are drawing a tremendous level of attention, which certainly will continue to grow in the future driven by the sustainability trend. This growing interest is related to their unsurpassed quintessential physical and chemical properties. Yet, owing to their hydrophilic nature, their utilization is restricted to applications involving hydrophilic or polar media, which limits their exploitation. With the presence of a large number of chemical functionalities within their structure, these building blocks provide a unique platform for significant surface modification through various chemistries. These chemical modifications are prerequisite, sometimes unavoidable, to adapt the interfacial properties of nanocellulose substrates or adjust their hydrophilic–hydrophobic balance. Therefore, various chemistries have been developed aiming to surface-modify these nano-sized substrates in order to confer to them specific properties, extending therefore their use to highly sophisticated applications. This review collocates current knowledge in the research and development of nanocelluloses and emphasizes more particularly on the chemical modification routes developed so far for their functionalization.},

abstract = {Macro, micro and nano fibrillary cellulose with sodium maleate groups was synthesized by the reaction of cellulose with maleic anhydride followed by sodium exchange of protons. In the present work, we demonstrate that these carboxylic groups act as chemisorbants towards toxic heavy metal ions present in contaminated water. The effects of the operating parameters such as resident time, temperature, pH, ion concentration and ion nature on chemisorbability were estimated for a given cellulose carboxylate. The kinetic results for the chemisorption of Pb2+ ion were indicative of an intra particle diffusion model and pseudo second order reaction. The chemisorption is well explained by a Freundlich isotherm model showing a multilayer chemisorption, heterogeneous surface and interaction between chemisorbed molecules. The chemisorption capability was enhanced upon decreasing the dimension of the cellulose fibril. The efficiency depended also on the nature of metal ions, dictated by the stability of the geometry of the resultant complex. The maximum chemisorption capacities of macro, micro and nano forms of sodium cellulose-maleate for Pb2+ were 20 mg/g, 40 mg/g and 115 mg/g, respectively at pH of 5.5. The ion exchanged nano-cellulose maleate could be regenerated by sodium chloride solution without loss of efficiency even after 7 cycles.},

Despite the facile nature of the technique, there has been a vigorous debate in the literature as to the mechanism of the reaction. One proposed mechanism, named supplemental activator and reducing agent atom transfer radical polymerization (SARA ATRP), has CuI as the major activator of alkyl halides, Cu0 acting as a supplemental activator, an inner-sphere electron transfer occurring during the activation step, and relatively slow comproportionation and disproportionation. In SARA ATRP slow activation of alkyl halides by Cu0 and comproportionation of CuII with Cu0 compensates for the small number of radicals lost to termination reactions. Alternatively, a mechanism named single electron transfer living radical polymerization (SET-LRP) assumes that the CuI species do not activate alkyl halides, but undergo instantaneous disproportionation, and that the relatively rapid polymerization is due to a fast reaction between alkyl halides and ?nascent?

In this article a critical assessment of the experimental data are presented on the polymerization of methyl acrylate in DMSO with Me6TREN as the ligand in the presence of Cu0, in order to discriminate between these two mechanisms. The experimental data agree with the SARA ATRP mechanism, since the activation of alkyl halides by CuI species is significantly faster than Cu0, the activation step involves inner-sphere electron transfer rather than an outer-sphere electron transfer, and in DMSO comproportionation is slow but occurs faster than disproportionation, and activation by CuI species is much faster than disproportionation. The rate of deactivation by CuII is essentially the same as the rate of activation by CuI, and the system is under ATRP equilibrium.

abstract = {The surface of a highly crystalline MoVTeNb oxide catalyst for selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid composed of the M1 phase has been studied by infrared spectroscopy, microcalorimetry, and in situ photoelectron spectroscopy. The acid-base properties of the catalyst have been probed by NH 3 adsorption showing mainly Br{\o}nsted acidity that is weak with respect to concentration and strength of sites. Adsorption of propane on the activated catalyst reveals the presence of a high number of energetically homogeneous propane adsorption sites, which is evidenced by constant differential heat of propane adsorption q diff,initial = 57 kJ mol -1 until the monolayer coverage is reached that corresponds to a surface density of approximately 3 propane molecules per nm 2 at 313 K. The decrease of the heat to q diff,initial = 40 kJ mol -1 after catalysis implies that the surface is restructured under reaction conditions. The changes have been analyzed with high-pressure in situ XPS while the catalyst was working applying reaction temperatures between 323 and 693 K, different feed compositions containing 0 mol.{\%} and 40 mol.{\%} steam and prolonged reaction times. The catalytic performance during the XPS experiments measured by mass spectrometry is in good agreement with studies in fixed-bed reactors at atmospheric pressure demonstrating that the XPS results taken under operation show the relevant active surface state. The experiments confirm that the surface composition of the M1 phase differs significantly from the bulk implying that the catalytically active sites are no part of the M1 crystal structure and occur on all terminating planes. Acrylic acid formation correlates with surface depletion in Mo 6+ and enrichment in V 5+ sites. In the presence of steam in the feed, the active ensemble for acrylic acid formation appears to consist of V 5+ oxo-species in close vicinity to Te 4+ sites in a Te/V ratio of 1.4. The active sites are formed under propane oxidation conditions and are embedded in a thin layer enriched in V, Te, and Nb on the surface of the structural stable self-supporting M1 phase. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The inclusion of nanomaterials into biopolymeric matrices followed by three-dimensional printing is poised to open new horizons in tissue engineering by generating customized 3D structures with optimized properties and multifunctionality. In this review, we present an overview on nanostructured ceramic, metal, carbon and polymer materials integrated with hard and soft forms of biopolymers for manufacturing both acellular and cellular 3D tissue constructs using a range of 3D-printing and bioprinting techniques. Property enhancements and emergence of new functional characteristics of biopolymeric composites with the incorporation of nanomaterials, followed by 3D printing are of particular interest. Several methods, including fused deposition modelling, stereolithography, selective laser sintering and bioprinting using droplet, laser and extrusion assisted techniques are presented. Significant modifications via surface functionalization, biodegradation of scaffolds and the cytotoxicity of nanocomposites are discussed. The results derived from in vitro and in vivo analysis of stem cells and 3D printed scaffolds, their interactions and degradations are highlighted. Advances with multiple nanomaterials are also discussed with the advantages of harnessing the potential of 3D printing to produce unique multifunctional nanocomposites for tissue engineering.},

@article{Gillespie1976,
abstract = {An exact method is presented for numerically calculating, within the framework of the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics, the time evolution of any spatially homogeneous mixture of molecular species which interreact through a specified set of coupled chemical reaction channels. The method is a compact, computer-oriented, Monte Carlo simulation procedure. It should be particularly useful for modeling the transient behavior of well-mixed gas-phase systems in which many molecular species participate in many highly coupled chemical reactions. For "ordinary" chemical systems in which fluctuations and correlations play no significant role, the method stands as an alternative to the traditional procedure of numerically solving the deterministic reaction rate equations. For nonlinear systems near chemical instabilities, where fluctuations and correlations may invalidate the deterministic equations, the method constitutes an efficient way of numerically examining the predictions of the stochastic master equation. Although fully equivalent to the spatially homogeneous master equation, the numerical simulation algorithm presented here is more directly based on a newly defined entity called "the reaction probability density function." The purpose of this article is to describe the mechanics of the simulation algorithm, and to establish in a rigorous, a priori manner its physical and mathematical validity; numerical applications to specific chemical systems will be presented in subsequent publications. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

abstract = {Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs), which are directly isolated as a native form, have drawn considerable attention as eco-friendly and distinctive material to be partly substituted for fossil products. In addition to the increasing attention to the native CNFs, conventional regenerated cellulose having cellulose II crystals also attracts more attention because of its cost-effective method of production in a moderately easy and repeatable fashion. Inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds are, in particular, thought to contribute greatly to the physical properties of cellulosic commercial products. More than half century ago, Marchessault et al. attempted to directly assign the hydroxyl (OH) group vibrations related to hydrogen bonding in infrared (IR) spectra. The assignment, however, has not been significantly updated. One reason for the delayed assignments is the difficulty in preparing pure cellulose II. Here, we show successful IR assignments of the interacted OH groups in cellulose II by using the nematic ordered cellulose to prepare a highly oriented regenerated film. The film had anisotropic crystalline domains, which provided a clearly resolved component in the IR spectra. The OH bands were well assigned, and this IR assignment becomes an effective tool to understand the structure–property relationship for engineering advanced regenerated cellulose materials.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the demand for sustainable energy devices (e.g. lithium ion batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells) has increased rapidly in recent decades. Nanocelluloses (NCs) from plants or bacteria have shown promising potential as their excellent physical, mechanical and optical properties, which are important for fabricating high-performance energy devices. NC materials and their applications in different areas have been extensively reviewed in literature. However, those reviews focused on more broad properties and applications of NC materials but the discussion on the energy applications are far from comprehensive. Technically, NCs are not electrically conductive; however, conductivity is essential for some core components of an energy device. Therefore, various chemical or physical modification approaches have been developed to prepare conductive NC-based materials. Because of the excellent physical properties of NC materials as well as the rapidly increasing demands on renewable materials based energy devices, enormous research efforts have been devoted to the NC-based conductive materials and energy devices. This paper is a comprehensive review focusing on the recent progress of fabricating conductive NC materials and the energy devices, including supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries and solar cells.},

abstract = {Poly($\epsilon$-caprolactone) (PCL) is a ductile, bioabsorbable polymer that has been employed as a blend partner for poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA). An improvement of the material strength and impact resistance of PLLA/PCL polymer blends compared to pure PLLA has been shown previously. To use numerical simulations in the design process of new components composed of the PLLA/PCL blend, a constitutive model for the material has to be established. In this work, a constitutive model for a PLLA/PCL polymer blend is established from the results of compressive tests at high and low strain rates at three different temperatures, including the body temperature. Finite element simulations of the split Hopkinson pressure bar test using the established constitutive model are carried out under the same condition as the experiments. During the experiments, the changes in the diameter and thickness of the specimens are captured by a high-speed video camera. The accuracy of the numerical model is tested by comparing the simulation results, such as the stress, strain, thickness and diameter histories of the specimens, with those measured in the experiments. The numerical model is also validated against an impact test of non-homogenous strains and strain rates. The results of this study provide a validated numerical model for a PLLA/PCL polymer blend at strain rates of up to 1800s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in the temperature range between 22°C and 50°C.},

The successful realization of this goal depends on the development of technologies to overcome the following challenges, including: 1) efficient biomass pretreatment and lignin separation technologies that overcomes its diverse structure and complex chemistry challenges to obtain high purity lignin; 2) advanced chemical analysis for precise quantitative characterization of the lignin in chemical transformation processes; 3) novel approaches for conversion of biomass-derived lignin to valuable products.

In order to analyse the various cellulose-reinforced polymer nanocomposites reported in literature, Cox-Krenchel and rule-of-mixture models have been used to elucidate the potential of nanocellulose in composite applications. There may be potential for improvement since the tensile modulus and strength of most cellulose nanocomposites reported in literature scale linearly with the tensile modulus and strength of the cellulose nanopaper structures. Better dispersion of individual cellulose nanofibres in the polymer matrix may improve composite properties.},

The milled cellulose particles maintained their original rod-like shapes after the milling process. However, a notable decrease in the crystallinity of milled cellulose particles with the increase of milling time was verified by using X-ray diffraction. The effects of milling time, initial cellulose concentrations and oil/water ratios on the droplet sizes and stability of cellulose particles-stabilized Pickering emulsions were investigated. The milled cellulose particles were irreversibly adsorbed at the oil/water interface and formed stable emulsions with droplet size between 40 and 60 $\mu$m, which exhibited good stability over one-month storage. Milled cellulose stabilized emulsions also exhibited good stability against a wide range of pH (3, 5, 7, 9) and salt conditions (0.1–100 mM) with slight change in the droplet sizes. The rheological tests indicated the formation of gel network in the emulsions, which further promoted the emulsion stability. As sustainable biomolecules without negative impact on environment, cellulose particles processed through media-milling open opportunities for developing environmentally friendly new materials for emulsion stabilization.},

abstract = {The three primary lignocellulosic biomass components (cellulose, xylan and lignin), synthetic biomass samples (prepared by mixing the three primary components) and lignocellulosic biomass (oak, spruce and pine) were pyrolysed in a thermogravimetric analyser and a wire mesh reactor. Different reactivities were observed between the three biomass components. Cellulose mainly produced condensables and was less dependent on heating rate, while xylan and lignin contributed most char yields and were significantly affected by heating rate. While xylan and lignin pyrolysed over a large temperature range and showed the behaviour characteristic of solid fuels, cellulose decomposition is sharp in a narrow temperature range, a behaviour typical of linear polymers. Comparison of the pyrolysis behaviour of individual components with that of their synthetic mixtures showed that interactions between cellulose and the other two components take place, but no interaction was found between xylan and lignin. No obvious interaction occurred for synthetic mixtures and lignocellulosic biomass at 325 °C, before the beginning of cellulose pyrolysis, in slow and high heating rate. At higher pyrolysis temperatures, more char was obtained for synthetic mixtures containing cellulose compared to the estimated value based on the individual components and their proportions in the mixture. For lignocellulosic biomass, less char and more tar were obtained than predicted from the components, which may be associated with the morphology of samples. The porous structure of lignocellulosic biomass provided a release route for pyrolysis vapours.},

abstract = {A 'grafting from' approach was used to graft poly($\epsilon$-caprolactone) (PCL) polymers to cellulose nanocrystals by Sn(Oct)2-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization (ROP). The grafting efficiency was evidenced by the long-term stability of suspension of PCL-grafted cellulose nanocrystals in toluene. These observations were confirmed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). Extracted nanohybrids were characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and contact angle measurements. The morphology and crystalline structure of the PCL-grafted cellulose nanocrystals was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-Ray diffraction, respectively. Results showed that cellulose nanocrystals kept their initial morphological integrity and their native crystallinity. Nanocomposites with high content of cellulose nanocrystals were prepared using either neat cellulose nanocrystals or PCL-grafted cellulose nanocrystals and high molecular weight PCL as matrix using a casting/evaporation technique. Thermo-mechanical properties of processed nanocomposites were studied by DSC, dynamical mechanical analyses (DMA) and tensile tests. A significant improvement in terms of Young's modulus and storage modulus was obtained. {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008.},

abstract = {Two kinetic models based on Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) and Eley-Rideal (ER) mechanisms were developed to describe the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to yield ethylene over a Mo-V-Te-Nb catalyst. Obtained in a lab-scale fixed-bed reactor, experimental data at the steady-state were used to estimate the kinetic models parameters via a nonisothermal regression. Experiments were performed using an ethane, oxygen and nitrogen mixture as feedstock, spanning temperatures from 673 to 753 K, inlet partial pressures of oxygen and ethane between 5.0 and 22.0 kPa, and space-time from 10 to 70 gcat h(molethane)--1. Ethylene, CO and CO2 were the only detected products, the selectivity for ethylene ranged from 76{\%} to 96{\%} for an ethane conversion interval 4-85{\%}. A series of tests feeding ethylene instead of ethane were also performed at 713 K, varying inlet partial pressures and space-time in the same ranges as was done for ethane. Ethylene conversion was relatively low, 3-14{\%}, the dominant product being CO with CO/CO2ratios from 0.73 to 0.79. The LH mechanism was found to represent better the experimental data. The oxydehydrogenation of ethane was the reaction with the lowest activation energy, 108-115 kJ mol-1. Except for the conversion of ethane into CO2, deep oxidations were detected as very energetically demanding steps, 156-193 kJ mol-1. Competitive adsorption between reagents and products occurred in the two mechanisms particularly at relatively high reaction severity, water re-adsorption being weaker in comparison with COx re-adsorption.},

However, for the in situ method, TEOS partially hydrolyzed to form some kind of microstructure and morphology of inorganic phases intertwisted with organic molecules. FTIR analysis indicated that the nanocomposites prepared from the in situ method had much higher curing rates than those from the blending method.

abstract = {Modification by Nd, Mn, Ga, and Ge substantially affect both physicochemical and catalytic properties of MoVNbTeO oxides in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE). The introduction of modifying additives changes the content of the M1 phase, surface acidity, and surface composition. It does not have an influence on the state of Mo, V, Nb, and Te on catalyst surface, but it induces surface enrichment (Ga, Mn) or depletion (Ge, Nd) by the modifying element. All of these additives have positive effects on catalytic properties at the M/Mo (M = modifying element) ratio of 0.0075 ÷ 0.025. They exhibit an increase of activity and prevent ethylene over-oxidation. The relationship between the rate constant of total ethane transformation and the M1 content confirms that this phase is active in ODE. The correlation between ethylene selectivity and the relative number of intermediate acid sites is revealed, indicating the role of surface acidity on ethylene over-oxidation.},

abstract = {Highly crystalline cellulose particles can be produced by acid hydrolysis through partially dissolving cellulose fibrils. 1-4 Such cellulose crystals have a rod or whisker shape with a diameter from 3 to 20 nm and a length from 100 nm to several $\mu$m depending on the hydrolysis conditions and the nature of the cellulose resource. 5,6 Because they are biodegradable and bio-compatible and have a high stiffness, high aspect ratio, low density, and a reactive surface that facilitates grafting chemical species to achieve different surface properties, cellulose nano-crystals reinforced nanocomposite materials are attracting increasing attention. 7,8 A specific challenge to overcome for broader application and to achieve maximum performance of such materials is the difficulty of obtaining well-dispersed, stable suspensions of cellulose nanocrystals in organic solvents and hydrophobic polymer matrices. Some attempts have been made to disperse cellulose whiskers in organic media by coating the cellulose nanocrystals with a surfactant 9-11 or surface chemical modification, e.g., partial silylation. 12,13 Controlled polymer grafting by living polymeriza-tion techniques, such as atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization, and ring-opening polymerization, have been carried out on cellulose fibers. The initiators were specifically immobilized on cellulose fibers through multivalent hydrogen-bonding interactions using the xyloglucan/xyloglucan endotrans-glycosylase technique 14-16 or the covalent linkage by direct chemical modification. 17-20 In these approaches, cellulose fibers were purified after the initiator immobilization. In addition, monomers and unbound polymers were carefully removed after the graft polymerization. Such purification processes are tedious and difficult, especially with cellulose nanocrystals. 21,22 The lignin-carbohydrate copolymer, hydroxypropyl lignin-block-cellulose propionate, has previously been used as a compa-tibilizer in composites of hydroxypropyl lignin and cellulose propionate. 23 Further, pullulan abietate, a model copolymer representing the lignin-carbohydrate complex, was applied to modify the cellulose model surface (Langmuir-Blodgett thin films of regenerated cellulose). 24 Glycopolymers, e.g., linear block copolymers of polystyrene and polysaccharides including dextran, maltodextrin, and maltoheptaose, have been synthe-sized by block synthesis methods using end-functionalized poly-styrene. 25-28 Such glycopolymers exhibited enhanced structural and physiological properties, e.g., blood anticoagulant activity, cell depletion, targeted drug delivery, etc. However, they have not previously been used for cellulose fiber surface modification. Herein, we report a new route for the surface modification of cellulose nanocrystals using a xyloglucan oligosaccharide-based triblock copolymer (Figure 1). Chiral nematic self-ordering of the cellulose nanocrystals with adsorbed copolymer was investigated in nonpolar solvent. Xyloglucan oligosaccharides (XGOs) were prepared from deoiled tamarind kernel powder (300 mesh, Maharashtra Tra-ders, India) using endoglucanase digestion. 14 Carboxylic acid-terminated polystyrene was synthesized using ATRP with 4-(1-bromoethyl)benzoic acid as the initiator 29 and had a weight-average molecular mass (M w) of 4572 and a polydispersity index (M w /M n , where M n is the number-average molecular mass) of 1.08. The xyloglucan oligosaccharide-poly(ethylene glycol)-polystyrene (XGO-PEG-PS) triblock copolymer was synthe-sized by coupling prefabricated linear blocks, i.e., reductive amination of XGOs with O,O 0 -bis(3-aminopropyl)poly(ethylene glycol) and subsequent carbodiimide-mediated N-acylation with carboxylic acid-terminated polystyrene. PEG was used as a compatible block between the carbohydrate (XGO) and hydro-phobic (PS) blocks and to increase the hydrophilicity of the copolymer. A diblock copolymer of XGO and PS precipitated from water and failed to stabilize the cellulose nanocrystals. The XGOs (2 g) and O,O 0 -bis(3-aminopropyl)poly(ethylene glycol) (amino-terminated PEG, Fluka 14535, M r ∼ 1500, 8 g) were dissolved in water (50 mL). Following the addition of sodium cyanoborohydride (2 g), the reaction was stirred at room temperature in the dark for 3 days. Acetic acid was then added until the solution reached pH 3.5. After evaporation and coeva-poration with methanol (3 {\^{A}} 50 mL), the reaction solution was concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was redissolved in 10 mL of deionized water and purified on a cationic exchange column (Resin Dowex 50WX4-400, gradient 0-5{\%} NH 3(aq)) for the removal of unreacted XGO. The product was then further purified on a size exclusion column (Biorad, Bio-Gel P2, 5 cm {\^{A}} 22 cm) to remove the excess of amino-terminated PEG. Fractions containing the product XGO-PEG-NH 2 were pooled and concentrated to dryness, yield 2.5 g.

abstract = {A systematic quantitative method for the selection of models for the high-conversion free radical polymerization exhibiting gel and glass effects has been developed. Four representative models were selected from the literature and were compared on the basis of the same experimental data. All models describe the isothermal time-conversion data over the entire conversion range for a single type and loading of initiator well. Models that are not considering the effect of molecular weight of the polymers on the diffusion of macro radicals fail to describe the time-conversion data if the concentration of the initiator varies at the same time. By simultaneous fitting of the conversion and polymerization degree data it was shown that the Marten-Hamielec model and its extended form (Panke-Stickler-Hamielec model) were not able to describe the number average polymerization degree Pn at the final conversion, where the glass effect occurs. This occurred because both models neglect the change of the radical efficiency f in this region, which has more effect on Pn than the change of the propagation rate coefficient (see part II of this series). {\textcopyright} 1997 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.

abstract = {Sisal fiber was pretreated by continuous screw extrusion steam explosion to prepare steam exploded sisal fiber (SESF) preforms. An amphipathic bio-based thermosetting resin with poor mechanical properties was cured by epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) and citric acid (CA). The obtained resin was used to modify SESF preforms and prepare eco-friendly biocomposites. The molar ratios (R) of carboxylic groups to epoxy groups and resin contents in biocomposites were adjusted. The biocomposites were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier-transfer infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), tensile testing, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), water absorption and water contact angle measurements. The maximum thermal decomposition temperature of the biocomposites was 373.1 °C. The curing efficiency of the resin in the biocomposites improved with the increase of resin content, and reached a maximum at R = 1.2. The tensile strength of the biocomposites reached a maximum of 30.4 MPa at R = 1.2 and 40{\%} resin content. SEM images showed excellent interfacial bonding and fracture mechanisms within the biocomposites. The biocomposites exhibited satisfactory water resistance. ESO resin cured with polybasic carboxylic acid is therefore a good bio-based modifier for lignocellulose, that prepare biocomposites with good mechanical properties, hydrophobicity, and thermostability, and which has a potential application in packaging.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Chemical Society. Over the past 10 years, the grafting of polymers from the surface of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) has gained substantial interest in both academia and industry due to the rapidly growing number of potential applications of surface-modified CNCs, which range from building blocks in nanocomposites and responsive nanomaterials to antimicrobial agents. CNCs are rod-like nanoparticles that can be isolated from renewable biosources and which exhibit high crystallinity, tunable aspect ratio, high stiffness, and strength. Upon drying, the abundance of surface hydroxyl groups often leads to a degree of irreversible aggregation, as a result of strong hydrogen bonding. Moreover, their relatively hydrophilic character renders CNCs incompatible with hydrophobic media, e.g., nonpolar solvents and polyolefin matrices. By grafting macromolecules from their surface, CNCs can be imparted with surface characteristics and other physicochemical properties that are reminiscent of the grafted polymer. This has allowed the design of nanoscale building blocks whose readily tunable properties are useful for the formation of both colloidal dispersions and solid state materials. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the morphology and surface chemistry of CNCs and detail various techniques to manipulate their surface chemistry via polymer grafting from approaches. Moreover, we explore the most common polymerization techniques that are used to graft polymers from the surface and reducing end groups of CNCs, including surface-initiated ring-opening polymerization (SI-ROP), surface-initiated free (SI-FRP), and controlled (SI-CRP) radical polymerization. Finally, we provide insights into some of the emerging applications and conclude with an outlook of future work that would benefit the field.},

In this study effect of incrementally increasing COOH and CHO groups at C2, C3, and C6 positions of cellulose and nanocellulose has been investigated, with a view to understanding their effect on thermal treatment of cellulose. The results show that 2,3-dialdehyde cellulose (DAC) is the most thermally stable oxidized product of cellulose while the most unstable derivatives contain carboxyl group at the C6 position (6CC). Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), with carboxymethyl group on C6 position, is more stable than 6CC. Multi-functionalized celluloses 2,3,6-tricarboxycellulose and 6-carboxy-2,3-dialdehyde, have the same level of thermal stability as 6CC, showing that the presence of carboxyl at the C6 is a key destabilizing factor in the thermal stability of oxidized cellulose products. More the number of reducing end groups on the polymer chain, lower the thermal stability of the cellulose, as proved by comparing the TGA/DTG of monomeric analogs dextrose, cellobiose and glucuronic acid with the oxidized celluloses. The thermal stability trend observed for oxidized celluloses was DAC {\textgreater} DCC {\textgreater} nanoparticles {\textgreater} dextrose {\textgreater} glucuronic acid, caused by extent of reducing ends and COOH groups. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

On the basis of literature kinetic and diffusion parameters, model analysis reveals that backbiting cannot be neglected for an accurate description of the NMP characteristics, despite the low number of SCBs formed per chain (ca. 2) and that the small loss of EGF at low conversions is mainly caused by chain transfer to monomer. SG1 partitioning (partitioning coefficient $\Gamma$ = 50) between the organic and aqueous phase increases the dispersity and polymerization rate at low particle diameters (dp {\textless} ca. 50 nm) with a limited effect on the EGF profile. However, the extent of these increases is very sensitive to the $\Gamma$ value, highlighting the relevance of its accurate experimental determination in future studies.},

Use of organic additives allows control of the concentration of metals in aqueous suspension. Reactions leading to crystalline M1 take place at 190 °C, i.e., approximately 400 °C lower than under current synthesis conditions. The evolution of solvated polyoxometalate ions and crystalline phases in the solid is monitored by spectroscopies. Catalysts prepared by this route show higher ODH activity compared to conventionally prepared catalysts. The higher activity is due not only to the high specific surface area but also to the corrugated lateral termination of the M1 crystals, as seen by atomic resolution electron microscopy, exposing a high concentration of catalytically active sites.},

Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and 1H NMR measurements were performed to determine the molecular weight, composition and chain microstructure of copolymers of L-lactide(LA):??-caprolactone(CL) synthesized using 90:10, 80:20, 75:25 and 70:30 feed ratios. The overall conversion of these PLCL copolymers was in the range of 80{\%}-90{\%} leading to weight average molecular weights (Mw) between 98,500 and 226,000 g mol -1 depending on feed composition and polymerization temperature. At temperatures lower than 140 ??C, the incorporation of CL units into polymer chains was incomplete because of the low reactivity of CL, thus at 120 ??C the copolymer composition was difficult to control obtaining more LA in the copolymer than the desired, hence the blocky character of PLCL copolymers also increased. At 150 ??C the catalyst was less effective and the molecular weights of the copolymers took lower values. A temperature of 140 ??C was established as optimal to obtain highest yields and molecular weight. The number average crystallizable lactide sequence lengths (lLA) shifted from 6.5 to 16.7 LA repeat units for PLCL polymerized at 140 ??C while the randomness character (R) value shifted from 0.4 for polymerization at 130 ??C to 0.6, at 150 ??C. Increasing the LA content in the copolymers the glass transition temperature and the crystallizability and melting temperature of PLCLs approached to that of PLLA homopolymer. The aging sensitivity of PLCLs increased with CL content. A double Tg behavior due to phase separation associated to crystallizing LA blocks was observed during aging. The mechanical properties, however, evolved toward the PLLA character when the molar content of LA in PLCL was increased from 66{\%} to 90{\%}, observing a shift from an elastomeric thermoplastic behavior to that of a glassy plastic, reflected by an increase in tensile modulus (from 12.0 to 1343.1 MPa) and a decrease in strain recovery after break (from 93.5{\%} to 25.0{\%}). Small amounts of CL content in the copolymers produced large improvements in their deformability with regard to PLLA. In addition, thermogravimetric analysis demonstrated that PLCLs are more stable to thermal degradation than PLLA and they undergo a more complex degradation mechanism than those of the corresponding homopolymers. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The effect of hydroxy and carboxylic acid substances on lactide polymerization in the presence of stannous octoate was investigated. A polymerization mechanism was postulated to attempt to explain the controversies existing in the literature and also to explain our experimental observations. Stannous alkoxide, a reaction product between stannous octoate and alcohol, is proposed as the substance initiating the polymerization through coordinative insertion of lactide. Alcohol can affect the polymerization through the reactions of initiator formation, chain transfer, and transesterfication. Carboxylic acid affects the polymerization through a deactivation reaction. Experiments showed that alcohol increased PLLA production rate while carboxylic acid decreased it. Both alcohol and carboxylic acid reduced PLLA final molecular weight. The higher the alcohol concentration, the lower the polymer molecular weight. However, the final molecular weight of PLLA was not sensitive to the carboxylic acid concentration. A polymerization induction period was observed at high carboxylic acid concentration, due to the deactivation reaction caused by carboxylic acid.},

abstract = {A ‘grafting from' approach was used to graft poly(3-caprolactone) (PCL) polymers to cellulose nanocrystals by Sn(Oct)2-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization (ROP). The grafting efficiency was evidenced by the long-term stability of suspension of PCL-grafted cellulose nanocrystals in toluene. These observations were confirmed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). Extracted nanohybrids were characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and contact angle measurements. The morphology and crystalline structure of the PCL-grafted cellulose nanocrystals was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-Ray diffraction, respectively. Results showed that cellulose nanocrystals kept their initial morphological integrity and their native crystallinity. Nanocomposites with high content of cellulose nanocrystals were prepared using either neat cellulose nanocrystals or PCL-grafted cellulose nanocrystals and high molecular weight PCL as matrix using a casting/evaporation technique. Thermo-mechanical properties of processed nanocomposites were studied by DSC, dynamical mechanical analyses (DMA) and tensile tests. A significant improvement in terms of Young's modulus and storage modulus was obtained. Introduction},

abstract = {Abstract A systematic quantitative method for the selection of models for the high-conversion free radical polymerization exhibiting gel and glass effects has been developed. Four representative models were selected from the literature and were compared on the basis of the same experimental data. All models describe the isothermal time-conversion data over the entire conversion range for a single type and loading of initiator well. Models that are not considering the effect of molecular weight of the polymers on the diffusion of macro radicals fail to describe the time-conversion data if the concentration of the initiator varies at the same time. By simultaneous fitting of the conversion and polymerization degree data it was shown that the Marten-Hamielec model and its extended form (Panke-Stickler-Hamielec model) were not able to describe the number average polymerization degree Pn at the final conversion, where the glass effect occurs. This occurred because both models neglect the change of the radical efficiency f in this region, which has more effect on Pn than the change of the propagation rate coefficient (see part II of this series). ? 1997 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.

abstract = {Polymer parts fabricated by 3D stereolithography (SL) tend to have much lower mechanical properties compared to their counterparts fabricated by conventional methods. Furthermore, due to cross linkage among polymer chains in the thermoset polymers, the SL printed parts tend to have low elongation and experience brittle fracture during failure. Various types of fillers have been added into photopolymer to improve the mechanical properties, with most of them being randomly dispersed. In this study, montmorillonite nanoclays (plate-shaped) are first exfoliated and homogenously dispersed in the photopolymer via several mixing steps, including sonification. After which, using the photopolymer dispersed with nanoclays in a bottom-up SL, the descending of build platform into the resin tank during the printing process provides a downward force to orientate the plate-shaped nanoclays in each layer. The nanoclays will be immobilized during photopolymerization upon ultra-violent (UV) exposure, thus maintaining their orientation and alignment. This process drastically improves the elongation by more than 100{\%} and enhances the tensile stress and Young's Modulus in the X-Y plane. This paper will also discuss the dispersion, alignment, size and loadings of the montorillonite nanoclays. This new approach will open up possibilities of printing high performance parts using stereolithography, increasing its functionality.},

These cross-linked polymers are heterogeneous networks caused by varying pendant reactivity and primary cyclization reactions. A kinetic model was utilized to probe the manner in which pendant double bonds react throughout the polymerization and to characterize the cycle size. The effects of crosslinking agent size, copolymerization, and solution polymerization were each examined. Increasing crosslinking agent size causes fewer small cycles to form and diminishes the total number of cycles that are created. Increasing the solvent concentration during polymerization has the converse effects of increasing the number of cycles that form within the first couple of repeat units and increasing the total fraction of pendants that form cycles. The model was further used to predict the molecular weight between crosslinks as a function of polymerization conditions.},

The study of photocross-linking kinetics by real-time photorheometry revealed the higher rate of photocross-linking of pure AESO than that of AESO with VDM or VDA. Through the higher yield of the insoluble fraction, better thermal and mechanical properties were obtained for the pure AESO polymer. Here, for the first time, we validate that pure AESO and mixtures of AESO and VDM can be used for 3D microstructuring by employing direct laser writing lithography technique. The smallest achieved spatial features are 1 $\mu$m with a throughput in 6900 voxels per second is obtained.

The chemical methods were based on NaOH-AQ (anthraquinone) and three-stage bleaching (DEpD) processes, whereas the mechanical techniques involved refining, cryo-crushing, and highpressure homogenization. The size and morphology of the obtained fibers were characterized by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the studies showed that the isolated nanofibers from unbleached and bleached pulp had diameters between 10-90 nm, while their length was in the micrometer range. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy demonstrated that the content of lignin and hemicellulose decreased in the pulping process and that lignin was almost completely removed during bleaching. Moreover, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that both pulp types as well as the nanofibers displayed a superior thermal stability as compared to the raw kenaf. Finally, X-ray analyses showed that the chemo-mechanical treatments altered the crystallinity of the pulp and the nanofibers: the bleached pulp had a higher crystallinity than its unbleached counterpart, and the bleached nanofibers presented the highest crystallinity of all the investigated materials.},

abstract = {Stereolithography (SLA) is a widely used technique for the fabrication of prototypes and small series products. The main advantage of SLA and related solid freeform fabrication (SFF) techniques is their capability to fabricate parts with complex shapes with high resolution. Although the spectrum of available materials has been widened in recent years, there is still a lack of materials which can be processed with SLA on a routine basis. In this work, a micro-SLA ($\nu$SLA) system is presented which can shape a number of different photopolymers with resolutions down to 5 $\nu$m in the xy-plane and 10 $\nu$m in the z-direction. The system is capable of processing various specifically tailored photopolymers which are based on acrylate chemistry. The materials processed for this work range from hybrid sol-gel materials (ORMOCER) to photo-crosslinked elastomers and hydrogels. The elastic moduli of these materials can be tuned over several orders of magnitude and range from 0.1 MPa to 8000 MPa. The reactivity of these monomers is sufficient for achieving writing speeds up to 500 mm s-1 which is comparable to commercial SLA resins. Various test structures are presented which show the suitability of the process for fabricating parts required for applications in micro-mechanical systems as well as for applications in biomedical engineering. Using the presented system, internal channels with a diameter of 50 $\nu$m and a length of 1500 $\nu$m could be fabricated. It was also possible to manufacture a micro-mechanical system consisting of a fixed axe and a free spinning turbine wheel. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Printability of a biomaterial is determined by the printing technique. Although a wide range of biomaterial inks including polymers, ceramics, hydrogels and composites have been developed, the field is still struggling with processing of these materials into self-supporting devices with tunable mechanics, degradation, and bioactivity.

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM)/3D printing (3DP) is a revolutionary technology which has been around for more than two decades, although the potential of this technique was not fully explored until recently. Because of the expansion of this technology in recent years, new materials and additives are being searched for to meet the growing demand. 3DP allows accurate fabrication of complicated models, however, structural anisotropy caused by the 3DP approaches could limit robust application. A possible solution to the inferior properties of the 3DP based materials compared to that of conventionally manufactured counterparts could be the incorporation of nanoparticles, such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) which have demonstrated remarkable mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. In this article we review some of the research, products, and challenges involved in 3DP technology. The importance of CNT dispersion in the matrix polymer is highlighted and the future outlook for the 3D printed polymer/CNT nanocomposites is presented.},

abstract = {An economic and biocompatible Schiff base tri-zinc catalyst was used to synthesize homo/copolymers of l-lactide (LA) and ??-caprolactone (CL) in bulk at first time. Both 1H and 13C NMR analyses show that LA is more active than CL, resulting in a poly(LA-grad-CL) copolymer with gradient sequence structure. A series of copolymers containing varying LA/CL ratios were readily synthesized. The chemical structure of poly(LA-grad-CL) was fully investigated using NMR and GPC technologies. TGA, DSC, DMA and nanoindentation instruments were employed to evaluate thermal and mechanical properties of these polymers. The results indicate that polymer composition and chain structure have a great impact on the crystallization behavior and crystallinity, as well as the thermal and mechanical properties of the copolymers. Therefore, the performance of the copolymer can be then tailored by simply adjusting the ratios of LA to CL.},

The bulk mixed metal oxide MoVTe(Sb)NbOx catalysts play a very important role in dehydrogenation and selective oxidation reactions of these short hydrocarbons to produce high-value chemicals. This catalyst system mainly consists of M1 and less-active M2 crystalline phases. Due to their ability to directly monitor the catalysts under the relevant industrial conditions, in situ/operando techniques can provide information about the nature of active sites, surface intermediates, and kinetics/mechanisms, and may help with the synthesis of new and better catalysts. Sophisticated catalyst design and understanding is necessary to achieve the desired performance (activity, selectivity, lifetime, etc.) at reasonable reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.). This article critically reviews the progress made in research of these MoVTe(Sb)NbOx catalysts in oxidation reactions mainly through in situ/operando techniques and suggests the future direction needed to realize the industrialization of these catalysts.},

abstract = {Objectives: Major changes are taking place in dental laboratories as a result of new digital technologies. Our aim is to provide an overview of these changes. In this article the reader will be introduced to the range of layered fabrication technologies and suggestions are made how these might be used in dentistry. Methods: Key publications in English from the past two decades are surveyed. Results: The first digital revolution took place many years ago now with the production of dental restorations such as veneers, inlays, crowns and bridges using dental CAD-CAM systems and new improved systems appear on the market with great rapidity. The reducing cost of processing power will ensure that these developments will continue as exemplified by the recent introduction of a new range of digital intra-oral scanners. With regard to the manufacture of prostheses this is currently dominated by subtractive machining technology but it is inevitable that the additive processing routes of layered fabrication, such as FDM, SLA, SLM and inkjet printing, will start to have an impact. In principle there is no reason why the technology cannot be extended to all aspects of production of dental prostheses and include customized implants, full denture construction and orthodontic appliances. In fact anything that you might expect a dental laboratory to produce can be done digitally and potentially more consistently, quicker and at a reduced cost. Significance: Dental device manufacturing will experience a second revolution when layered fabrication techniques reach the point of being able to produce high quality dental prostheses. The challenge for the dental materials research community is to marry the technology with materials that are suitable for use in dentistry. This can potentially take dental materials research in a totally different direction. {\textcopyright} 2011 Academy of Dental Materials.},

In this study, the antifouling properties of CNCs and CNFs, modified ultrafiltration (UF) membranes, were directly compared. A facile modification method was conducted by coating CNCs and CNFs on the surface of polyethersulfone (PES) membranes to prepare CNC-coating membranes and the CNF-coating membranes. Membrane surface morphology was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the results showed that the CNF-coating membranes exhibited greater surface roughness than the CNC-coating membranes. Pure water flux measurements demonstrated that the flux of the CNC-coating membranes was slightly lower than that of the CNF-coating membranes. Antifouling properties were evaluated and compared for the two types of membranes by filtration of NOM foulant models, humic acid (HA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA). The results showed that the antifouling properties of the modified membranes were enhanced through the coating of either CNCs or CNFs to a control PES membrane. The CNC-coating membranes outperformed the CNF-coating membranes in alleviating both reversible fouling and irreversible fouling caused by HA and BSA. In addition, the antifouling performance of the coating membranes was enhanced with increased coating content.},

The most suitable formulation was developed using silver acetate to obtain 1{\%} by weight of AgNPs in the final 3D structures. The presence of the filler causes an increase in the physical and mechanical properties of the samples that become significantly stiffer and stronger than the pristine matrix. Antibacterial properties and electrical conductivity measurements performed on the printed samples gave promising results for the use of the developed formulation for the building of 3D polymeric structures with improved multifunctional properties.},

abstract = {Nanocelluloses, including nanocrystalline cellulose, nanofibrillated cellulose and bacterial cellulose nanofibers, have become fascinating building blocks for the design of new biomaterials. Derived from the must abundant and renewable biopolymer, they are drawing a tremendous level of attention, which certainly will continue to grow in the future driven by the sustainability trend. This growing interest is related to their unsurpassed quintessential physical and chemical properties. Yet, owing to their hydrophilic nature, their utilization is restricted to applications involving hydrophilic or polar media, which limits their exploitation. With the presence of a large number of chemical functionalities within their structure, these building blocks provide a unique platform for significant surface modification through various chemistries. These chemical modifications are prerequisite, sometimes unavoidable, to adapt the interfacial properties of nanocellulose substrates or adjust their hydrophilic–hydrophobic balance. Therefore, various chemistries have been developed aiming to surface-modify these nano-sized substrates in order to confer to them specific properties, extending therefore their use to highly sophisticated applications. This review collocates current knowledge in the research and development of nanocelluloses and emphasizes more particularly on the chemical modification routes developed so far for their functionalization.},

Peer-to-peer platforms for resource sharing represent a frequently discussed field of application for “trust-free” blockchain technology. However, trust between peers plays a crucial and complex role in virtually all sharing economy interactions. In this article, we hence shed light on how these conflicting notions may be resolved and explore the potential of blockchain technology for dissolving the issue of trust in the sharing economy. By means of a dual literature review we find that 1) the conceptualization of trust differs substantially between the contexts of blockchain and the sharing economy, 2) blockchain technology is to some degree suitable to replace trust in platform providers, and that 3) trust-free systems are hardly transferable to sharing economy interactions and will crucially depend on the development of trusted interfaces for blockchain-based sharing economy ecosystems.},

Combining mathematical rigor with an informal writing style, it thoroughly introduces the theory underlying numerical methods, its translation into MATLAB programs, and its use for solving realistic problems. Specific topics covered include accuracy, convergence and numerical stability, as well as stiffness and ill-conditioning. MATLAB codes are developed from scratch, and their implementation is explained in detail, all while assuming limited programming knowledge. All scripts employed are downloadable, and built-in MATLAB functions are discussed and contextualised. Numerous examples and homework problems - from simple questions to extended case studies - accompany the text, allowing students to develop a deep appreciation for the range of real chemical engineering problems that can be solved using numerical methods. This is the ideal resource for a single-semester course on numerical methods, as well as other chemical engineering courses taught over multiple semesters.},

Arnol'd puts a clear emphasis on the qualitative andgeometric properties of ODEs and their solutions, rather than on theroutinepresentation of algorithms for solving special classes of equations.Of course,the reader learns how to solve equations, but with much more understanding ofthe systems, the solutions and the techniques. Vector fields and one-parametergroups of transformations come right from the startand Arnol'd uses this"language" throughout the book. This fundamental difference from the standardpresentation allows him to explain some of the real mathematics of ODEs in avery understandable way and without hidingthe substance. The text is also richwith examples and connections with mechanics. Where possible, Arnol'd proceedsby physical reasoning, using it as a convenient shorthand for much longerformal mathematical reasoning. This technique helps the student get a feel forthe subject. Following Arnol'd's guiding geometric and qualitative principles,there are 272 figures in the book, but not a single complicated formula. Also,the text is peppered with historicalremarks, which put the material incontext, showing how the ideas have developped since Newton and Leibniz. Thisbook is an excellent text for a course whose goal is a mathematical treatmentof differential equations and the related physical systems.},

The removal of these wide varieties of pollutants for better quality of water for various activities is an emerging issue and a robust and eco-friendly treatment technology is needed for the purpose. It is well known that cellulosic materials can be obtained from various natural sources and can be employed as cheap adsorbents. Their adsorption capacities for heavy metal ions and other aquatic pollutants can be significantly affected upon chemical treatment. In general, chemically modified cellulose exhibits higher adsorption capacities for various aquatic pollutants than their unmodified forms. Numerous chemicals have been used for cellulose modifications which include mineral and organic acids, bases, oxidizing agent, organic compounds, etc. This paper reviews the current state of research on the use of cellulose, a naturally occurring material, its modified forms and their efficacy as adsorbents for the removal of various pollutants from waste streams. In this review, an extensive list of various cellulose-based adsorbents from literature has been compiled and their adsorption capacities under various conditions for the removal of various pollutants, as available in the literature, are presented along with highlighting and discussing the key advancement on the preparation of cellulose-based adsorbents. It is evident from the literature survey presented herein that modified cellulose-based adsorbents exhibit good potential for the removal of various aquatic pollutants. However, still there is a need to find out the practical utility of these adsorbents on a commercial scale, leading to the improvement of pollution control.},

abstract = {Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are a rare subset of pancreatic neoplasms. We report the case of a 33-year-old female patient who was admitted to the Diabetes Clinic of Craiova, Romania, due to a two-year history of episodic neuroglycopenic hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic symptoms, suggestive for insulinoma associated with facial and upper trunk flushing characteristic to carcinoid syndrome. During these episodes, the laboratory investigations showed hypoglycemia (38 mg÷dL), hyperinsulinemia (54.72 $\mu$U÷mL) and normal values of beta-hydroxybutyrate, chromogranin A, serotonin, anti-insulin antibodies and urinary levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Endoscopic ultrasound with SonoVue and 3T MRI revealed an 18.3÷16.3 mm hypervascular tissular mass situated in the uncinate process of the pancreatic head in close contact with the superior mesenteric vein without invasion and no other detectable secondary lesions in the pancreas or any other abdominal viscera. Patient underwent enucleation of pancreatic tumor. The histological and immunohistochemical findings indicated a functional well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, G1 category according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, with uncertain behavior (Ki67 index was 3{\%}), confined to the pancreas, but with tumoral invasion of the delimiting conjunctive capsule. No evidence of tumoral CK19 staining, mitoses and necrosis, angioinvasion or extra-pancreatic invasion was observed. A post-operative nine-month follow-up showed resolution of hypoglycemic symptoms, normalized blood glucose and insulin levels and no evidence of recurrence. Our case report highlights the pitfalls in diagnosing a functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor due to atypical symptoms, the difficulty of identification and precise location of the small-size tumor and uncertain histopathological and immunohistochemical behavior.},

abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study was to compare the physical and mechanical properties of stereolithography (SLA)- manufactured alumina ceramics of different composition to those of subtractive- manufactured ceramics and to produce suitable dental crown frameworks. Methods The physical and mechanical properties of a control and six experimental SLA ceramics prepared from slurries with small (S) and large (L) particles (0.46 ± 0.03 and 1.56 ± 0.04 $\mu$m, respectively) and three dry matter contents (70{\%}, 75{\%}, 80{\%}) were evaluated by dynamic rheometry, hydrostatic weighing, three3-point flexural strength measurements, and Weibull analyses, and by the micrometrics measurement of shrinkage ratio before and after the heat treatments. Results S75 was the only small particle slurry with a significantly higher viscosity than L70. The viscosity of the S80 slurry made it impossible to take rheological measurements. The viscosities of the S75 and S80 slurries caused deformations in the printed layers during SLA manufacturing and were excluded from further consideration. SLA samples with low dry matter content had significantly lower and densityflexural strengths. Only SLA samples with a large particle size and high dry matter content (L75 and L80) were similar in density and flexural strength to the subtractive- manufactured samples. The 95{\%} confidence intervals of the Weibull modulus of the L80 ceramic were higher (no overlap fraction) than those of the L75 ceramic and were similar to the control (overlap fraction). The Weibull characteristics of L80 ceramic were higher than those of L75 ceramic and the control. SLA can be used to process suitable crown frameworks but shows results in anisotropic shrinkage. Significance The hH High particle size and dry matter content of the L80 slurry allowed made it possible to produce a reliable ceramic by SLA manufacturing with an anisotropic shrinkage, and a density, and flexural strength similar to those of a subtractive-manufactured ceramic. SLA allowed made it possible to build up a dense 3D alumina crown framework with controlled shape. Further studies on the marginal adaptation and shrinkage model of alumina crown frameworks will be required to optimize the process.},

However, valorization rate of annually produced lignin is less than 2{\%}, suggesting the need for technological advancement to capitalize lignin as a versatile feedstock. In recent years, efficient utilization of lignin has attracted wide attention. This paper summarizes the research advances in the utilization of lignin resources (mainly in the last three years), with a particular emphasis on two major approaches of lignin utilization: catalytic degradation into aromatics and thermochemical treatment for carbon material production. Hydrogenolysis, direct pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction, and hydrothermal carbonization of lignin are discussed in detail. Based on this critical review, future research directions and development prospects are proposed for sustainable and cost-effective lignin valorization.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 - IOS Press and the authors. Composite materials of photo-crosslinked poly(trimethylene carbonate) and nanoscale hydroxyapatite were prepared and their mechanical characteristics for application as orbital floor implants were assessed. The composites were prepared by solvent casting poly(trimethylene carbonate) macromers with varying amounts of nano-hydroxyapatite and subsequent photocrosslinking. The incorporation of the nano-hydroxyapatite into the composites was examined by thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy and gel content measurements. The mechanical properties were investigated by tensile testing and trouser tearing experiments. Our results show that nano-hydroxyapatite particles can readily be incorporated into photocrosslinked poly(trimethylene carbonate) networks. Compared to the networks without nano-hydroxyapatite, incorporation of 36.3 wt.{\%} of the apatite resulted in an increase of the E modulus, yield strength and tensile strength from 2.2 MPa to 51 MPa, 0.5 to 1.4 N/mm2 and from 1.3 to 3.9 N/mm2, respectively.We found that composites containing 12.4 wt.{\%} nano-hydroxyapatite had the highest values of strain at break, toughness and average tear propagation strength (376{\%}, 777 N/mm2 and 3.1 N/mm2, respectively).},

The biosynthesis of macromolecules through enzymatic bacterial and chemical polymerizations of specific molecular structures constitutes a key step in the evolution of living organisms. Natural polymers have therefore been around for a very long time and always constituted one of the essential ingredients of sustainability, first and foremost as food, but also as shelter, clothing, and source of energy. These renewable resources have also played an increasingly important role as materials for humanity through their exploitation in a progressively more elaborated fashion. The ever improving technologies associated with papermaking, textile and wood processing, vegetable oils, starch and gelatin utilization, the manufacture of adhesives, etc. represent clear examples of the progressive sophistication with which man has made good use of these natural polymers throughout the millennia. Concurrently, natural monomers have been polymerized empirically for equally long periods for applications such as coatings, paint and ink setting, leather tanning, etc.},

There will be times when solving the exact solution for the equation may be unavailable or the means to solve it will be unavailable. At these times and most of the time explicit and implicit methods will be used in place of exact solution. In the simpler cases, ordinary differential equations or ODEs, the forward Euler's method and backward Euler's method are efficient methods to yield fairly accurate approximations of the actual solutions. By manipulating such methods, one can find ways to provide good approximations compared to the exact solution of parabolic partial differential equations and nonlinear parabolic differential equations. Further, the experimental results show that smaller h values result in reduction in error which is true in both cases of differential equations.},

While rapid curing and good spatial resolution are advantages to these systems, brittleness and poor impact resistance due to inhomogeneous polymer architecture and high crosslink density are serious drawbacks. By comparison, epoxy thermoset resins suffered many years ago from similar problems, but since then are found in ever demanding applications thanks to a variety of approaches to increase polymer toughness. Based on these successes, researchers have tried to translate strategies for toughening epoxy resins to photopolymer networks. Therefore, this review surveys relevant scientific papers and patents on the development of crosslinked epoxy-based polymers and also photo-curable polymers based on multifunctional acrylates with improved toughness. Strategies developed to reduce brittleness include working with monomers, which intrinsically give tougher polymers, particulate additives, and alternate forms of polymerization and polymer architecture (e.g., dual-cure networks, interpenetrating networks, thiol-ene chemistry). All of these strategies have advantages and yet application specific rigours must also be considered before and during formulation development.},

Modeling is widely applied to optimize the polymerization conditions and processes. In addition, there are numerous literatures on the kinetic and reactor models for RDRP processes, which show the accessibility on polymerization kinetics insight, process optimization, and controlling over chain microstructure with predetermined molecular weight and low dispersity, copolymer composition distribution, and sequence distribution. This review highlights the facility of the method of moments in the modeling field and presents a summary of the present state-of-the-art and future perspectives focusing on the model-based RDRP processes based on the method of moments. Summary on the current status and challenges is discussed briefly.

The structure of the COEs is confirmed by infrared spectroscopy, 1H, and 13C-NMR, while the molecular weight distribution of the COEs is determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectroscopy. The cyclic oligoesters are then successfully polymerized via ring-opening polymerization using tetrakis(2-ethylhexyl)-titanate as catalyst. Differential scanning calorimetry and 1H-NMR analysis unambiguously proves the formation of polymeric species. Both end-group analysis from 1H-NMR spectrum and calculation through Flory-Fox equation give comparable estimates of the number average molecular weight: 5.8 × 103 g mol-1 and 7.8 × 103 g mol-1, respectively. Furanic polyesters, derived from renewable 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid, are highly attractive polymers and sustainable substitutes of some performance-related fossil-based commodities like polyethylene terephthalate. In this work a new synthetic pathway for the production of furan-based polyesters is reported. Cyclic oligoesters of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid and butane diol are chemically synthesized by semi-batch esterification. The cycles are then successfully polymerized via ring-opening polymerization.},

abstract = {Efficient recovery of valuable materials from by-products of pulping has been a strong asset to the environmental concern. The objectives of this research were to recovery and utilization of lignin from kraft black liquor. Lignins of oil palm empty fruit bunch were isolated from kraft black liquor by acidic method. Results showed that the optimal condition of kraft lignin precipitation was at pH 3, which contributed the higher yield and purity of isolated lignin. The chemical and physical properties of isolated lignin was characterized as a mixture of lignin-agarose hydrogel by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), respectively. Lignin and agarose hydrogel were synthesized by chemical crosslinking of epichlorohydrin (ECH). The lignin-agarose hydrogel obtained at 5{\%}lignin, 5{\%} agarose and ECH 10 mL provided the higher mechanical properties when compared to other conditions. Gel strength of lignin-agarose hydrogel has been comprehensively determined by texture personal analysis (TPA).},

Using literature-based mechanistic models, a micro-kinetic model was derived based on parameter optimization and a model discrimination procedure. The model described the rates of formation of all nitrogen-containing products, i.e. N2, N2O and NO. Catalyst characterization of platinum samples by electron microscopy indicated that reaction-induced restructuring of the Pt surface limited the accuracy of derived kinetic parameters already at the low temperature applied in this work. Despite of necessary simplifications, the best-fitting kinetic model predicted reasonable product selectivities for the reaction conditions of an industrial ammonia burner. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Multi-material 3D printing with several mechanically distinct materials at once has expanded the potential applications for additive manufacturing technology. Fewer material options exist, however, for additive systems that employ vat photopolymerization (such as stereolithography, SLA, and digital light projection, DLP, 3D printers), which are more commonly used for advanced engineering prototypes and manufacturing. Those material selections that do exist are limited in their capacity for fusion due to disparate chemical and physical properties, limiting the potential mechanical range for multi-material printed composites. Here, we present an ethylene glycol phenyl ether acrylate (EGPEA)-based formulation for a polymer resin yielding a range of elastic moduli between 0.6 MPa and 31 MPa simply by altering the ratio of monomer and crosslinker feedstocks in the formulation. This simple chemistry is also well suited to form seamless adhesions between mechanically dissimilar formulations, making it a promising candidate for multi-material DLP 3D printing. Preliminary tests with these polymer formulations indicate that variability due to molecular differences between hard and soft formulations is less than 3{\%} of the prescribed model dimensions, comparable to existing commercial DLP and SLA resins, with unique advantages of a wide range of elastomer stiffness and seamless fusion for 3D printing of structurally detailed and mechanically heterogeneous composites.},

abstract = {Propane oxidation at 653-673 K and benzyl alcohol oxidation at 393 K over phase-pure MoV(TeNb) M1 oxide catalysts were studied to gain insight into the multiple catalytic functions of the surface of the M1 structure. Electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction confirmed the phase purity of the M1 catalysts. Propane oxidation yields acrylic acid via propene as intermediate, while benzyl alcohol oxidation gives benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, benzyl benzoate, and toluene. The consumption rates of benzyl alcohol and propane level in the same range despite huge difference in reaction temperature, suggesting high activity of M1 for alcohol oxidation. Metal-oxygen sites on the M1 surface are responsible for the conversion of the two reactants. However, different types of active sites and reaction mechanisms may be involved. Omitting Te and Nb from the M1 framework eliminates acrylic acid selectivity in propane oxidation, while the product distribution in benzyl alcohol oxidation remains unchanged. The results suggest that the surface of M1 possesses several types of active sites that likely perform a complex interplay under the harsh propane oxidation condition. Possible reaction pathways and mechanisms are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

First, soybean oil methacrylates with various function-alities were successfully synthesized from epoxidized soybean oil as an alternative to commercially available soybean oil acrylate. A library of photoresins was created by mixing up to 80{\%} of the biobased (meth)acrylate oligomers with biobased diluents and a photoinitiator. The resin composition was optimized to achieve a maximum biobased content and a low viscosity. The manufactured parts demonstrated complete layer fusion and accurate print quality. Stiffness and toughness can be tuned by altering the chemical composition or the number of functional groups per oligomer. These biobased materials can be employed to reduce the environmental impact of additive manufacturing while being competitive with current fossil-based resins from commercial manufacturers.},

abstract = {The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene (ODH-Et) is investigated over a high activity-selectivity MoVTeNb mixed oxide. Experiments are performed using a mixture of ethane, oxygen and nitrogen as feedstock, at temperatures from 400 to 480°C, inlet partial pressures of oxygen and ethane from 5.0 to 24.2kPa, and space-times from 10 to 140gcathmolethane-1. Ethylene selectivity varies from 76{\%} to 96{\%}, for an ethane conversion range 17-85{\%}. In a set of experiments at 440°C feeding ethylene instead of ethane, ethylene conversion is from 3{\%} to 14{\%} and COx are the only reaction products, the CO being the dominant species with a selectivity range 73-79{\%}. Kinetic models based on Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) and Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) formalisms, and combinations of them are developed to describe the ODH-Et. Physicochemical and statistical criteria are employed to contrast the performance of these kinetic approaches. The LHHW kinetics exhibits the best capacity to represent the observations, being a potential model for the conceptual design of ODH-Et reactors in future investigations. Kinetic parameters indicate: (i) ethylene formation is the reaction demanding the lowest activation energy; (ii) total oxidations of ethane are the reactions demanding the largest activation energies; (iii) reaction rates, including that of catalyst oxidation, are weakly affected by changes in the oxygen partial pressure, explaining the high selectivity to ethylene of MoVTeNbO; and (iv) water is the component with the highest affinity to be adsorbed on active sites affecting negatively reaction rates. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The flexibility in polymer processing plays an important role in the development of controlled delivery devices for a range of applications related to drugs, food-related bioactive ingredients, and genes. Biopolymers are generally synthesized by an organism or plant and have a more complex chemical structure than that of synthetic polymers. Many pharmaceutical companies now use controlled-/sustained-delivery technologies to improve existing therapeutic agents simply by controlling the rate at which they enter the bloodstream, thus reducing and ideally avoiding under- or overdosing. Temperature-sensitive hydrogels are probably the most commonly studied class of sensitive polymer systems in drug delivery research. They have gained considerable attention in the pharmaceuticals field due to their ability to swell or shrink as a result of changes in temperature. The tanning of biological materials with quinones alters their mechanical and solubility properties, making them insoluble in water, detergents, organic solvents, and strong acids and alkalies. The use of ionic cross-linking has recently gained importance in medical and pharmaceutical applications. The importance of biopolymers in the development of matrices for the controlled release of drugs and other bioactive compounds will continue to increase. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A novel biological friendly shape memory polymer (SMP) based on ethyl cellulose (EC) and polycaprolactone (PCL) was prepared. The network structure of the polymer was formed by linear EC backbones which were linked by grafted PCL chains, and the results showed outstanding mechanical strength and shape memory property of this polymer. The tensile modulus varied from 104.9 to 373.4 MPa while the tensile strength ranged from 155.4 to 323.6 MPa. And the elongations at break were all above 621{\%}. The shape memory switching temperature could be modulated to 37.2 °C by decreasing the chain length of graft PCL. As EC and PCL are both biodegradable and biocompatible materials, this new polymer has potential application in biomedical field, like biomedical suture, which would be further studied in the future. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

And finally Dennis Hansen and Marianne who I have had the pleasure of sharing a fume-hood with. Resume: In this report we will be synthesizing poly-caprolactone via a number of different initiators, from mon-functional to tetra-functional. A tetra-functional initiator means that it has 4 arms each ending in a –OH group able to start the polymerization process, tri-means three –OH groups etc. The initiators used is PP150 (ethoxylated pentaerythritol), pentaerythritol, Di-TMP, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,4-butanediol and allylalcohol. As catalyst I will be using Sn(Oct) 2 , tin octoate. The method of polymerization here is a ROP (Ring Opening Polymerization) coordination-insertion, which means the cyclic ester ring is opened and inserted in the tin alkoxide bond. The resulting polymer will be analyzed via SEC, DSC, NMR, IR and TGA to establish the average molecular weight, its structure and its thermal stability. The attempt to control the polymers size and end groups is done via polymerization, esterification of hydroxyl-groups and a thio-Michael addition.},

Slight differences have been found in activation energy depending on the analytical methods used and reported in other previous articles. It was found that the activation energy of thermal degradation increased with increasing the molecular weight of PLA. Moreover, the behaviors involved in the thermal degradation of PLA in nitrogen atmosphere were studied by using the numerical simulation of the kinetic model to dynamical thermogravimetric data. The maximum decomposition temperature, shape index for dynamic condition and life, and degree of decomposition for the isothermal condition of thermal behavior of PLA are predicted via mathematical simulation in this study.},

Hydrogel thickness was a strong function of PEG concentration, PI type and concentration, and energy dosage, and these results were utilized to successfully fabricate complex hydrogel structures using SL, including structures with internal channels of various orientations and multi-material structures. Additionally, human dermal fibroblasts were encapsulated in bioactive PEG photocrosslinked in SL. Cell viability was at least 87{\%} at 2 and 24h following fabrication.

abstract = {Abstract A kinetic model has been developed for stable free-radical polymerization (SFRP) processes by using the method of moments. This model predicts monomer conversion, number-average molecular weight, and polydispersity of molecular weight distribution. The effects of the concentrations of initiator, stable radical, and monomer, as well as the rate constants of initiation, propagation, termination, transfer, and the equilibrium constant between active and dormant species, are systematically investigated by using this model. It is shown that the ideal living-radical polymerization having a linear relationship between number-average molecular weight and conversion and a polydispersity close to unity is the result of fast initiation, slow propagation, absence of radical termination, and a high level of dormant species. Increasing stable radical concentration helps to reduce polydispersity but also decreases polymerization rate. Thermal initiation significantly broadens molecular weight distribution. Without the formation of dormant species, the model predicts a conventional free-radical polymerization. ? 1999 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc. J Polym Sci B: Polym Phys 37: 2692?2704, 1999},

In this paper, we propose a simple and fundamental conceptual model that defines the chemical product design problem as the inversion of three central design functions: quality, property and process functions. The classic iterative cycles of product design problems may be envisioned as alternating between inversion and evaluation of these three functions, or in other words alternating between synthesis and analysis of solutions. On top of the proposed basic structure of the overall design problem, we then discuss the formulation of some subproblems as optimization problems and describe some useful solution tools. Three application examples are provided, including a more detailed case of formulation of a pharmaceutical ointment.},

Formation of acetic acid, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide has been incorporated using a holistic reaction mechanism. The proposed model is based on two different oxygen sites, namely, lattice oxygen causing carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage and electrophilic surface oxygen responsible for the formation of carbon-oxygen bonds. It is found that carbon dioxide exclusively originates from decarboxylation of acetate species, while ethene selectively reacts to CO. Consumption and formation of all species are well predicted by the proposed model. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate the strong impact of the initial carbon-hydrogen cleavage on the net ethene production rate. Moreover, regeneration of lattice oxygen sites is found to become rate-determining at oxygen-lean conditions.},

Thus the potential applications of these structures for tissue engineering have not been fully realized. In this paper we demonstrate that conventional post-lithography treatments followed by processing in the environmentally benign solvent, supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2), dramatically increased biocompatibility. The scCO2 processing of pure polyacrylate and polyacrylate/hydroxyapatite composite structures extracts residuals from all structures including those that had received full conventional post-lithography treatment (acetone washing/UV drying). Human osteoblast cells seeded on the extracted surfaces of these structures demonstrated increased cell attachment and proliferation on the scCO2-treated materials. {\textcopyright} 2008 Acta Materialia Inc.},

As to what has gone wrong with lean, the answer is nearly everything: ambiguous terms and concepts, trivializing the essence, botching the basics, going through the motions, analysis paralysis, puffery masking action, abetting organizational silos, discontinuity, and losing interest.

The analysis evidenced the efficient grafting of alkyne functions at the surface of the fibers, the DS being 0.5. The resulting MCC-Alkyne fibers were introduced within a bi-component reactive silicone formulation (up to 20 wt{\%}), allowing the formation of network through hydrosilylation reaction in which MCC-Alkyne played the role of a reactive fillers. Comparison between the properties of composites prepared with unmodified MCC and MCC-Alkyne highlighted a densification of the network and an enhancement of mechanical and thermal properties when coupling reactions occurred.

abstract = {Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs), also known as nanofibrillar cellulose, are an advanced biomaterial made mainly from renewable forest and agricultural resources that have demonstrated exceptional performance in nanopapers. CNFs possess many unique properties such as nano-scale dimension, high surface area, unique morphology, low density, and superior mechanical strength. Noticeably, CNFs can be easily (chemically) modified and are readily available, renewable, and biodegradable, and thus they are ideal building blocks for nanopapers. In turn, cellulose nanopapers distinguish from traditional papers because of their optical transparency, superior mechanical strength, low density, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and low porosity. This chapter focuses on the progress in the production of CNFs including pretreatment and mechanical isolation, manufacturing of nanopapers, integration of new functionalities such as optical transparency, thermal, electrical, and magnetic properties into cellulose nanopapers, their unprecedented performance, as well as a variety of sustainable, green, and environmentally friendly applications that have been explored so far. Examples of applications for cellulose nanopapers include transparent and flexible transistors and electronics, optical sensing, membranes for water purification, and electret nanogenerators. The general implications for developing future CNF-based nanopapers are also illustrated.},

A fixed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure was employed, feeding a mixture of ethane, oxygen, and nitrogen. Ethane conversion varied from 17 to 85{\%}, whereas selectivity for ethylene and COx varied from 94 to 76{\%} and from 4.0 to 24{\%}, respectively.

The EGS and ESO, for comparison, were used neat and in blends with diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA). Thermosetting resins were fabricated with the epoxy monomers and either BF3 catalyst or anhydride. The curing behaviors, glass transition temperatures, crosslink densities and mechanical properties were tested. The results indicated that polymer glass transition temperatures were mostly a function of oxirane content with additional influence of glycidyl versus internal oxirane reactivity, pendant chain content, and chemical structure and presence of saturated components. EGS provided better compatibility with DGEBA, improved intermolecular crosslinking and glass transition temperature, and yielded mechanically stronger polymerized materials than materials obtained using ESO. Other benefits of the EGS resin blend systems were significantly reduced viscosities compared to either DGEBA or ESO-blended DGEBA counterparts. Therefore, EGS that is derived from renewable sources has improved potential for fabrication of structural and structurally complex epoxy composites, e.g., by vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding. {\textcopyright} BME-PT.},

abstract = {Replacing the widespread use of petroleum-derived non-biodegradable materials with green and sustainable materials is a pressing challenge that is gaining increasing attention by the scientific community. One such system is cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) derived from acid hydrolysis of cellulosic materials, such as plants, tunicates and agriculture biomass. The utilization of colloidal CNCs can aid in the reduction of carbon dioxide that is responsible for global warming and climate change. CNCs are excellent candidates for the design and development of functional nanomaterials in many applications due to several attractive features, such as high surface area, hydroxyl groups for functionalization, colloidal stability, low toxicity, chirality and mechanical strength. Several large scale manufacturing facilities have been commissioned to produce CNCs of up to 1000 kg/day, and this has generated increasing interests in both academic and industrial laboratories. In this feature article, we will describe the recent development of functionalized cellulose nanocrystals for several important applications in ours and other laboratories. We will highlight some challenges and offer perspectives on the potentials of these sustainable nanomaterials.},

abstract = {Cyclic polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) was polymerized with 2-ethylhexanoic acid tin(II) salt activated by 1-dodecanol in order to study the reaction mechanisms dominant in ring-opening polymerization (ROP) for polyester synthesis. Initiator-to-monomer content and temperatures were varied from 0.05{\%} to 0.5{\%} and 190 °C to 250 °C, respectively. The living-like character of ROP was confirmed by the characteristic effect of initiator content on cyclic oligomer conversion, along with the linear dependence of the number-average molecular weight upon conversion. The molecular weight distribution is mainly a function of the interplay between chain transfer and transesterification reactions. Since the PBT macrocycles appear in different sizes from 2 to 7 repeat units, each carbonyl group theoretically contributes to ring reactivity, where in this system both size-dependent and size-independent approaches to simulate propagation deliver appreciable results. The corresponding rate constants have been determined and, in contrast to other polymer systems, the proximity of these values to those of chain transfer and transesterification is significant.},

Superhydro-phobicity has stimulated much scientific and industrial interest because of applications in water repellency, self-cleaning, friction reduction, antifouling, etc. Despite its inherent hydrophilicity, cellulose has unparalleled advantages as a substrate for the production of super-hydrophobic materials. This is because of its abundance, biodegradability and unique physical, chemical and mechanical properties that compare advantageously with the non-renewable materials typically used. This review includes a comprehensive survey of the progress achieved so far in the production of super-hydrophobic materials based on cellulose. Emphasis is placed on the effects of cellulose surface chemistry and topography, both of which affect hydrophobicity. Overall, this contribution summarizes some of the aspects that are critical to advance this evolving field of science.},

Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane (C2-ODH) is an alternative catalytic technology for producing ethylene using a natural gas feedstock. North American olefin plants have switched from a heavy petroleum feedstock to a light ethane feedstock due to the shale revolution. The M1 catalyst, advanced by co-author, Dr. Anne M. Gaffney, selectively and exothermically transforms ethane to ethylene under mild conditions (300–400 °C, 4–7 atm).

abstract = {The most recent developments and progress in the utilization of gums can be found in the field of edible coatings. Edible and biodegradable films have the potential to reduce packaging and limit moisture, aroma, and lipid migration between food components. Edible films can be produced from hydrocolloids, lipids, resins, and composites. There are many methods for forming films directly on food surfaces. The coating procedure involves wetting a surface with a coating gum solution, followed by the solution's possible penetration, and potential adhesion between the two commodities. Creating a successful coating that adheres to a food surface requires an estimation of the interfacial tension between the coating solution and the surface. There are many methods to evaluate coatings' properties. Edible films and coatings should be chosen based on their suitability to the task at hand. Manufacturers of novel edible films need to take many issues into consideration. These include barrier stability, mechanical properties, simplicity of application, and biodegradability. It is expected that future edible films will include antimicrobial edible films, added-value fruit and vegetable films, and invisible edible films, and that the tools of nanotechnology will be used to achieve developments in packaging and film-production technologies. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Because post-processing operations are performed by skilled workers and require additional time and cost, the reduction of post-processing time and cost is a high priority. Basic approaches to minimizing post-processing are investigated. Surface roughness is analyzed through theoretical models and experiments developing an interpolation method to predict the behavior of the roughness under various equipment conditions and fabrication styles are conducted. Part orientation is optimized by a post-processing objective function. To accelerate the optimization, a model mapping method is developed and verified. An expert system is implemented by the suggested algorithms and examined by several models in real a workshop. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODH-Et) seems the most promising alternative to produce ethylene compared to conventional processes. Nevertheless, there is not even a pilot plant for ODH-Et worldwide nowadays. This work presents the simulation of the catalytic behavior of a highly active and selective MoVTeNbO catalyst for the ODH-Et in a wall-cooled industrial-scale packed-bed reactor with a tube to particle diameter ratio equal to 3.12. The feasibility of using this complex yet necessary reactor design, as well as the influence of operating conditions on conversion and yield along the reactor are analyzed. The simulations are carried out using a two-dimensional pseudo-heterogeneous model, which makes use of both a reliable kinetic model and reliable transport parameters. Specifically, the kinetic model, obtained from lab-scale experimental data, is coupled to the reactor model accounting for transport phenomena wherein the effect of hydrodynamics on heat transfer is assessed from independent experiments in absence of reaction in an industrial-scale reactor. The developed kinetics successfully accounts for both the inhibiting effect of adsorbed water on oxidative dehydrogenation and total oxidations and the effect of the inlet partial pressure of oxygen and ethane on conversion and selectivity. Besides, the reactor model elucidates the importance of accounting for the role of the hydrodynamics on the heat transport in order to have reliable conversion and yield predictions. From the parametric sensitivity study, the temperature of the coolant fluid and the inlet ethane concentration are variables for tuning the reactor performance.},

abstract = {Nanocellulose has generated a great deal of interest as a source of nanometer-sized reinforcement, because of its good mechanical properties. In the last few years, nanocellulose has also attracted much attention due to environmental concerns. This review presents an overview of recent developments in this area, including the production, characterization, properties, and range of applications of nanocellulose-based biodegradable polymers, thermoplastic polymers, and porous nanocomposites. After explaining the unique properties of nanocellulose and its various preparation techniques, an orderly introduction of various nanocellulose-reinforced biodegradable polymers such as starch, proteins, alginate, chitosan, and gelatin is provided. Subsequently, the effects of nanocellulose on the properties of thermoplastic polymers such as polyamides, polysulfone, polypropyrol, and polyacronitril are reported. The paper concludes with a presentation of new finding and cutting-edge studies on nanocellulose foam and aerogel composites. Three different types of aerogels, i.e., pristine nanocellulose-based aerogels, modified nanocellulose-based aerogels, and nanocellulose-based templates for aerogels, are discussed, as well as their preparation techniques and properties. In the case of foam composites, the research focus has been on two major preparation techniques, i.e., solvent-mixing/foaming and melt-mixing foaming, their respective challenges, and the properties of the final composites. In some cases, a comparison study between cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose nanofiber-reinforced biodegradable polymers, thermoplastics, and porous nanocomposites was carried out. Considering the vast amount of research on nanocellulose-based composites, special emphasis on such composites isprovided at the end of the review.},

Poly($\epsilon$ -caprolactone) was incubated in a natural environment - sea water (the Baltic Sea), in buffered salt solution, in liquid medium containing sea water with NaN3 and in compost with plant treatment activated sludge (under natural and laboratory conditions). The characteristic parameters of sea water and compost with active sludge are described. Their influence on degradation of modified poly($\epsilon$ -caprolactone) is discussed. Weight changes, viscosity, tensile strength, DSC parameters of melting and crystallization and changes in morphology of polymer surface were tested during the period of biodegradation. In liquid medium containing sea water with sodium azide and in buffered salt solution the slow hydrolysis process of poly($\epsilon$ -caprolactone) was observed. In natural environments the poly($\epsilon$ -caprolactone) film was completely assimilated after seven weeks of incubation. This means that poly($\epsilon$ -caprolactone) modified by slip and anti-block one additives was very sensitive to an enzymatic attack by microorganisms present in the Baltic Sea water and in the compost with activated sludge under natural conditions.},

abstract = {Stereocomplex-type polylactides (sc-PLA), consisting of both enantiomeric poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) and poly(D-lactic acid) (PDLA), can potentially act as high performance polymers because their melting temperature (Tm ¼ 230C) is 50C higher than that of the single PLLA or PDLA polymer (180C). The stereocomplex(sc) crystal form of sc-PLA is triclinic or trigonal with both 31 (or 32 and 31) helical PLLA and PDLA chains packed side by side, which is quite different from the homochiral (hc) pseudo-orthorhombic or orthorhombic crystal forms. Since their improved thermal and mechanical properties facilitate a wider application,varioustrialsoftheformationofsc-PLAhavebeendone. Simple mixing of high molecular weight PLLA and PDLA, however, is likely to lead to hc crystallization rather than sc crystallization to retard the thermal stability of the resultant polymer blends. To promote sc crystallization, stereoblocktype PLA (sb-PLA), a block copolymer of PLLA and PDLA, has been developed. The covalent bond of the enantiomeric sequences of PLLA and PDLA favor sc crystallization of the copolymer. The sb-PLA can be synthesized by solid-state polycondensation (SSP) of a mixture of PLLA and PDLA having medium molecular weight as well as by stepwise ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of D- and L-lactides.},

Gaps were found between the L-CNC and MA matrix in 3D-SL printed nanocomposites before postcure. However, gaps decreased after postcure due to interactions between the L-CNC and MA molecules. Mechanical properties increased with the addition of 0.1{\%} and 0.5{\%} L-CNC after postcure, and the thermal stability was improved at 0.5{\%} L-CNC. Dynamic mechanical analysis demonstrated that incorporation of L-CNC increased the storage modulus in the rubbery plateau. The loss factor had two transition regions, which gradually changed by merging together with increasing L-CNC content, and a broadening of the transition region was observed after postcure. In particular, the mechanical and thermal properties of 3D-SL printed nanocomposites, after postcure, exhibited higher improvement than those before postcure.},

abstract = {Novel soybean-oil-based (SBO-based) epoxy acrylate (EA) resins were developed via ring-opening reaction of epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) with hydroxyethyl methacrylated maleate (HEMAMA) precursor, a synthesized unsaturated carboxylic acid having two active C{\^{a}}•C groups and a side methyl group. Experimental conditions for the synthesis of the precursor and the SBO-based EA (ESO-HEMAMA) product were studied, and their chemical structures were confirmed by FT-IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and gel permeation chromatography. Subsequently, the volatility of HEMAMA was studied and compared with acrylic acid (AA). Furthermore, gel contents and ultimate properties of the UV-cured ESO-HEMAMA resins were investigated and compared with a commercial acrylated ESO (AESO) resin. At last, UV-curing behaviors of the SBO-based EA resins were determined by real-time IR. It was found that the HEMAMA precursor showed much lower volatility than AA, and the optimal pure ESO-HEMAMA resin possessed a C{\^{a}}•C functionality up to 6.02 per ESO and biobased content of 65.4{\%}. Meanwhile, the obtained ESO-HEMAMA biomaterials exhibited much superior properties as compared to the AESO resin. For instance, the obtained pure ESO-HEMAMA material possessed a storage modulus at 25 °C of 1.00 GPa, glass transition temperature (Tg) of 70.1 °C, and tensile strength and modulus of 13.4 and 592.1 MPa, which were 9.4, 3.6, 6.9, and 15.7 times the values of the pure AESO material, respectively. The resulting biomaterial with 30{\%} of hydroxyethyl methacrylate diluent even reached a tensile strength of 28.4 MPa and Tg of 89.0 °C. Therefore, the developed SBO-based EA resins are very promising for applications in UV-curable coatings.},

The multifunctionality of the M1 phase, which is known as a selective catalyst for the direct oxidation of propane to acrylic acid, was furthermore reflected in the formation of 1-butene and isobutene owing to C4 isomerization.

@article{Zeng2017,
abstract = {In this study, we report the curing of ESO with biobased dicarboxylic acids (DCAs) with different carbon chain-lengths to synthesize fully sustainable polymers. Both non-isothermal and isothermal curing processes analysis indicated that the curing rate and activation energy decreased with increasing chain-length of DCAs. The optimum [sbnd]COOH/epoxy molar ratio is 0.7 for preparation of ESO/DCA cured product with maximum degree of crosslinking. Addition of 4-N, N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as a catalyst can efficiently accelerate the curing rate and reduce activation energy. We systemtically studied the effect of chain-length of DCAs on the physical properties of cured products, and found that with increase in chain-length of DCAs, the glass transition temperature of the cured ESO/DCA decreased, the tensile strength and Young's modulus increased while elongation at break decreased, due to the decreased crosslinking density resulted from the increased chain-length between crosslinking sites. All cured ESO/DCA showed excellent thermal stability with initial decomposition temperature of higher than 340 °C.},

@article{Marvin1971,
abstract = {Most absolute measurements of viscosity have utilized capillary flow, and required semiempirical corrections amounting to several times their precision and estimated accuracy. The range of values found from these measurements and the possibility of unrecognized systematic errors make it impossible to base a realistic estimate of accuracy on the results of only one type of measurement. The results of two independent absolute measurements involving different types of flow, reported in the two accompanying papers, are summarized here. The estimated accuracy in each case is about 0.1 percent. The two results differ by 0.5 percent. It is suggested that we continue to base the calibration of relative viscometers on the value of 1.002 centipoise (cP) for the viscosity of water at 20 deg C and one atmosphere. This provides a generally accepted base which limits comparability only by the precision of the measurements. However, whenever the true values of viscosity are required the limits of uncertainty including an estimate of systematic error should be taken as no better than +/- 0.25 percent.},

abstract = {Nanocelluloses are natural materials with at least one dimension in the nano-scale. They combine important cellulose properties with the features of nanomaterials and open new horizons for materials science and its applications. The field of nanocellulose materials is subdivided into three domains: biotechnologically produced bacterial nanocellulose hydrogels, mechanically delaminated cellulose nanofibers, and hydrolytically extracted cellulose nanocrystals. This review article describes today's state regarding the production, structural details, physicochemical properties, and innovative applications of these nanocelluloses. Promising technical applications including gels/foams, thickeners/stabilizers as well as reinforcing agents have been proposed and research from last five years indicates new potential for groundbreaking innovations in the areas of cosmetic products, wound dressings, drug carriers, medical implants, tissue engineering, food and composites. The current state of worldwide commercialization and the challenge of reducing nanocellulose production costs are also discussed.},
